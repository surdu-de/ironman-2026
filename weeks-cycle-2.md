### Week 8: Dec 29 - Jan 4 (Recovery)
**Actual:** ~4h vs 5h55 planned

**Recovery Week Violations:**
- Tuesday: Tempo bike 76min @ 148W avg (should have been easy 45min @ 110W)
- Wednesday: Extended ride 171min @ 148W (should have been 60min easy)

**Impact:** Recovery compromised. Violations may have primed cumulative fatigue for Cycle 3.

**Learning:** Recovery weeks MUST be strictly easy to allow adaptation.

## Cycle 2 Learnings

1. **Endurance base expanded** - Long bike to 3h+, long run to 2h+
2. **Self-coaching works** - Smart workout upgrades improved training quality
3. **Power discipline needed** - Often ran too hot (165W vs 120-135W target)
4. **HR discipline for runs** - Ran by pace/feel, not HR cap
5. **Recovery violations hurt** - Week 8 tempo work defeated recovery purpose
6. **Holiday flexibility** - Maintained quality despite Christmas disruptions
