## Detailed Workouts

### Mon Dec 1 ✅
**Rest Day**
- status:: completed

### Tue Dec 2 ⚠️
**Modified:** Completed bike with different workout, skipped swim

#### 🚴 Bike (17:45-18:25)
**Sprint Intervals - 40min**

**Structure:** 10min warmup + 32x(10s sprint + 20s recovery) + 10min cooldown
- **Sprints:** 10s @ 262-297W (average ~277W per sprint)
- **Peak power:** 356-532W during sprints
- **Recovery:** 20s @ 102-160W active recovery
- **5min recovery breaks:** After intervals 16 and 32 @ 111-115W
- **HR progression:** Started 117 bpm warmup → peaked 160 bpm final intervals

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-02
- duration-planned:: 55
- duration-actual:: 40.4
- distance-planned:: ~28
- distance-actual:: 22.84
- avg-hr:: 130
- max-hr:: 160
- avg-power:: 138
- max-power:: 532
- np:: 147
- tss:: 29.6
- zone-target:: Sweetspot (237W / 108% FTP)
- zone-actual:: Z2-Z3 (138W avg, sprint peaks 277W avg)
- status:: modified
- notes:: Garmin prescribed sprint workout. Structure: 32 short sprints with minimal recovery. Sprint power averaged 277W (126% FTP) but short duration (10s) with only 20s recovery created insufficient work intervals. Overall average power (138W = 63% FTP) too low vs. target sweetspot (237W = 108% FTP). This workout demonstrated Garmin's disconnect from Ironman training needs - too many short efforts vs. sustained threshold work.

#### 🏊 Swim - SKIPPED
**Planned:** 1000m Easy Technique
- status:: skipped
- notes:: Evening swim session not completed

### Wed Dec 3 ⚠️
**Modified:** Completed two bike sessions, skipped strength

#### 🚴 Bike Session 1 (7:17-8:07)
**Sprint Intervals - 50min**

**Structure:** 15min warmup + 12x(10s sprint + 2min recovery) + 5min cooldown
- **Sprints:** 10s @ 259-290W (average 268W per sprint)
- **Recovery:** 2min @ 75-79W
- **Longer recovery breaks:** 5min @ 110-111W (after intervals 4 and 8)

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-03
- duration-planned:: 59
- duration-actual:: 50.2
- distance-planned:: ~30
- distance-actual:: 27.92
- avg-hr:: 121
- max-hr:: 143
- avg-power:: 110
- max-power:: 499
- np:: 122
- tss:: 25.4
- zone-target:: Z4 Threshold (190W)
- zone-actual:: Z2 Recovery (110W avg, sprint peaks 259-290W)
- status:: modified
- aerobic-te:: 2.6
- notes:: Garmin prescribed sprint session. Very low average power (110W) due to long recovery periods. Sprint intervals averaged 268W (122% FTP) but only 10s duration with 2min recovery made overall intensity too low for quality threshold work. This workout structure didn't provide sufficient training stimulus.

#### 🚴 Bike Session 2 (8:07-8:18)
**Custom 10-Second Max Intervals - 11min**

**Structure:** 24s warmup + 10x(10s max sprint + 50s recovery) + 41s cooldown
- **Max sprints:** 10s all-out @ 429-488W (average 468W per sprint)
- **Peak power:** 600-676W during sprints
- **Recovery:** 50s @ 124-136W active recovery
- **Progression:** HR climbed from 139 (interval 1) to 157 (final recovery)

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-03
- duration-actual:: 10.6
- distance-actual:: 5.83
- avg-hr:: 149
- max-hr:: 165
- avg-power:: 182
- max-power:: 676
- np:: 220
- tss:: 16.7
- zone-target:: Max Power / Anaerobic
- zone-actual:: Z5+ (Anaerobic)
- status:: completed
- aerobic-te:: 2.2
- notes:: **CUSTOM WORKOUT created after disappointing Garmin session.** Designed to test true anaerobic capacity with 10s max efforts. Successfully achieved proper intensity - sprint power averaged 468W (213% FTP), peak 676W (307% FTP). HR climbed progressively to 165 max showing cumulative anaerobic load. NP of 220W = 100% FTP validates current fitness level. This demonstrates need for self-designed workouts that match actual training goals vs. generic Garmin prescriptions.

#### 💪 Strength - SKIPPED
**Planned:** Garmin Total Body Circuit 3
- status:: skipped
- notes:: Strength session not completed

### Thu Dec 4 ✅

- zone-actual:: Z3-Z4
- status:: completed
- aerobic-te:: 3.0
- calories:: 769
- notes:: **CSS RESULT: 2:27/100m - NEW PERSONAL RECORD!** Improved from 2:33/100m baseline (6 seconds faster). Test completed with 1350m total distance including warmup/cooldown and two time trials. Excellent technique efficiency with consistent stroke rate (23 SPM) and good Swolf score (117). This establishes new training zones for upcoming swim sessions.

### Fri Dec 5 ✅
**Rest Day (Off-Plan Recovery)**

After Thursday's triple training day (run + bike + CSS swim test), took complete rest instead of planned swim session.

- activity:: Rest
- date:: 2025-12-05
- status:: completed
- notes:: Off-plan rest day. Appropriate recovery choice after Thursday's high training load (TE 4.0 run + 3.2 bike + 3.0 swim = 10.2 total TE). Skipped planned 1000m technique swim to prioritize recovery.

### Sat Dec 6 ✅
**Rest Day (Off-Plan Recovery)**

Extended recovery period continued. Both planned sessions (tempo bike + run threshold test) skipped.

- activity:: Rest
- date:: 2025-12-06
- status:: completed
- notes:: Second consecutive rest day. Skipped planned tempo bike (76min) and run threshold test (60min). Recovery week principle maintained with significantly reduced training volume.

### Sun Dec 7 ⏳
**Run Threshold Test - PENDING**

**Moved from Saturday:** 30-minute threshold test (originally scheduled Sat Dec 6)

**Protocol:**
- Warmup: ~10-15min easy
- **30-minute TIME TRIAL:** Run as hard as you can sustain for 30 minutes
  - Target pace: ~4:35/km (13s/km faster than 4:48 baseline)
  - Even pacing critical
  - Record average pace and average HR
- Cooldown: ~10min easy/walking

**Target Distance:** ~6.5km in 30min @ 4:35/km pace

**Purpose:**
- Establish run training zones for Weeks 5-30
- Test if lactate threshold has improved from baseline
- Complete Week 4 testing objective alongside CSS swim test

**Context:** Strategic placement after 2-day rest (Fri-Sat) provides fresh legs for accurate threshold assessment. This completes the experimentation phase of recovery week - testing both prescribed workouts (Garmin) and personal limits (threshold capacity).

- date:: 2025-12-07
- status:: pending
- notes:: Final test of Week 4 experimentation phase. Will establish whether threshold pace improved from 4:48/km baseline.

## Week 4 Summary & Analysis

### Actual Training Load
**Completed Sessions:** 7 workouts over 4 training days
- **Monday:** Rest (planned)
- **Tuesday:** 1 bike session (40min) - swim skipped
- **Wednesday:** 2 bike sessions (50min + 11min) - strength skipped
- **Thursday:** 3 sessions - run (45min) + bike (26min) + swim CSS test (57min)
- **Friday-Saturday:** Rest days (off-plan recovery)
- **Sunday:** Run pending

**Actual Weekly Volume:**
- **Bike:** 4 sessions, ~127min (~2h07)
- **Run:** 1 session, ~45min (+ pending Sunday run)
- **Swim:** 1 session (CSS test), ~57min
- **Total:** ~229min (~3h49) completed, significantly reduced from planned 6h55

### Key Deviations from Plan
1. **Recovery Strategy:** Condensed training into Mon-Thu block, then extended rest Fri-Sat
2. **Skipped Sessions:**
   - Tuesday swim (1000m technique)
   - Wednesday strength (25min circuit)
   - Friday swim (1000m technique)
   - Saturday bike tempo (76min) + run threshold test (60min)
3. **Added Sessions:**
   - Thursday unplanned threshold run (45min, 8.51km)
   - Wednesday extra 10s intervals test (11min)
4. **Modified Workouts:**
   - Tuesday bike: Different sprint structure, lower intensity (138W vs 237W target)
   - Wednesday bike: Recovery pace (110W vs 190W threshold target)
   - Thursday bike: Shortened (26min vs 76min planned)

### Key Achievement
**CSS Swim Test:** **2:27/100m - PERSONAL RECORD**
- Improved from 2:33/100m baseline (**6 seconds faster**)
- Establishes new swim training zones for remaining 26 weeks
- Excellent technique metrics: 23 SPM stroke rate, Swolf 117

### Recovery Week Assessment
**Appropriateness:** ✅ Excellent
- Significantly reduced volume (3h49 vs 6h55 planned = 45% reduction)
- High-quality CSS test result despite recovery week
- Smart adaptation: condensed training, extended rest period
- One testing objective achieved (CSS), run threshold test deferred

**Strategic Use of Recovery Week:**
Recovery weeks aren't just for rest - they're perfect for experimentation and learning. With reduced volume and lower stakes:
- **Tested Garmin workouts** to evaluate if they match training needs
- **Discovered personal limits** through custom interval design
- **Identified capability gaps** between prescribed and actual intensity tolerance
- **Gained critical data** for designing effective Weeks 5-30

This experimentation approach transforms recovery week from passive rest into active learning about what training stimulus actually works. The insights gained here will inform all future workout design - understanding limits is essential before programming 26 more weeks.

### Key Learning: Garmin Coach Limitations
**Decision:** Moving away from Garmin Coach prescribed workouts for future weeks

**Concrete Issues Identified:**

1. **Tuesday Sprint Workout (32x 10s sprints)**
   - Target: Sweetspot 237W (108% FTP) sustained work
   - Actual: 138W average (63% FTP) - too many short bursts with long recoveries
   - Structure failure: 10s sprints don't build Ironman-specific sustained power
   - Result: Recovery ride intensity when threshold work was needed

2. **Wednesday Sprint Workout (12x 10s sprints)**
   - Similar pattern: 110W average, sprint peaks only 268W
   - 2-minute recovery periods between 10s efforts = insufficient training load
   - Too easy for intended purpose

3. **Custom Workout Success (10x 10s max efforts)**
   - Designed immediately after disappointing Garmin session
   - Achieved proper anaerobic stimulus: 468W average per sprint (213% FTP)
   - Peak power 676W (307% FTP)
   - Shorter 50s recoveries created cumulative fatigue (HR climbed to 165)
   - Demonstrated that self-designed intervals achieve training goals

**Core Problem:** Garmin prescriptions favor short sprint intervals over sustained efforts. Ironman requires:
- Sustained sweetspot/threshold work (20-60min intervals)
- Tempo endurance (60-180min Z3)
- Not sprint capacity training

**Solution for Week 5+:** Design custom workouts targeting:
- Long sweetspot intervals (2x20min, 3x15min @ 95-105% FTP)
- Threshold builds (40-60min progressive efforts @ 85-95% FTP)
- Tempo endurance rides (2-4h @ 70-80% FTP)
- Run threshold intervals aligned with Ironman pacing strategy

This realization during Week 4 (recovery/testing week) is perfectly timed - entering Week 5 (start of new build cycle) with clear direction for targeted, self-designed training sessions.

### Training Zone Updates
- **FTP Bike:** 220W (updated from 188W prior to Week 4, not formally tested this week)
- **CSS Swim:** **2:27/100m** (NEW - tested Thu Dec 4, improved from 2:33 baseline, 6s faster)
- **Run Threshold:** Testing today (Sunday) - target 4:35/km (vs 4:48 baseline, seeking 13s improvement)

---

## Week Completion
**Progress:** ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ⏳ (6/7 days completed, 1 pending)

**Training Zones (Updated Dec 7):**
- **FTP Bike:** 220W (updated from 188W before Week 4, not tested this week)
- **CSS Swim:** **2:27/100m** ⬆️ (tested Thu Dec 4, +6s from 2:33 baseline)
- **Run Threshold:** Testing today Sun Dec 7 (target 4:35/km, +13s from 4:48 baseline)
