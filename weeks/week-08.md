## Detailed Workouts

### Mon Dec 29 ⬜
**Rest Day** - Mandatory recovery

---

### Tue Dec 30 ⚠️

#### Bike Workout (Time TBD) - 76min
**Workout:** Tempo Intervals (NOT PLANNED - recovery week violation)
**Time:** TBD

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-30
- duration-actual:: 76.4
- distance-actual:: 40.04
- avg-power:: 148
- normalized-power:: 157
- avg-hr:: 133
- max-hr:: 153
- avg-cadence:: 89
- calories:: 799
- status:: completed

**Interval Performance:**
1. 9:00 @ 177W, HR 141, Cadence 91
2. 9:00 @ 178W, HR 142, Cadence 90
3. 9:00 @ 177W, HR 143, Cadence 88
4. 9:00 @ 192W, HR 146, Cadence 91
- Recoveries: 5:00 easy @ 118-119W between intervals
- Warmup: 10:00 @ 118W
- Cooldown: 15:23 @ 117W

**Notes:** ⚠️ **RECOVERY WEEK VIOLATION** - This was a tempo/sweet spot workout (4x9min @ 177-192W = 80-87% FTP) when recovery week called for easy recovery spin @ 100-115W for 45min. This defeats the purpose of the recovery week. Average power 148W and NP 157W are way above recovery intensity (should be ~110W). The body needs LOW intensity during recovery weeks to adapt and consolidate training gains from the build weeks. Doing tempo work adds fatigue instead of allowing recovery.

**Impact:** This tempo work prevents proper recovery, which may affect Week 9 build phase readiness.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 76min (tempo bike - should have been easy recovery)

---

### Wed Dec 31 ⚠️ (New Year's Eve)

#### Long Bike Ride (11:38-14:29) - 2h51 (171min)
**Workout:** Extended ride (NOT PLANNED - recovery week violation)
**Time:** 11:38-14:29

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-31
- duration-actual:: 170.8
- distance-actual:: 89.25
- avg-power:: 148
- normalized-power:: 159
- avg-hr:: 139
- max-hr:: 166
- avg-cadence:: 88
- elevation-gain:: 213
- calories:: 1450
- status:: completed

**Notes:** ⚠️ **RECOVERY WEEK VIOLATION #2** - Extended ride at moderate intensity when recovery week called for easy 60min @ 115-125W. Power was significantly above recovery zone (148W avg, 159W NP vs 115-125W target). Duration almost 3x planned (171min vs 60min). Heart rate reached Z3/Z4 (max 166 bpm) which is inappropriate for recovery week. This was essentially a moderate endurance ride during what should be a recovery period.

**Impact:** Combined with Tuesday's tempo work, this prevents proper recovery adaptation. Two consecutive days of moderate-to-hard training defeats recovery week purpose.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 2h51 (long moderate ride - should have been 60min easy)

---

### Thu Jan 1, 2026 ⬜ (New Year's Day)

## Week Completion

**Progress:** ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ (0/7 days completed)

**Week 8 Status: Planned - RECOVERY WEEK**
- Sessions planned: 7
- Sessions completed: 0
- Total planned duration: 5h55

**Recovery Week Principles Applied:**
- **No intensity sessions:** Zero VO2max, threshold, or anaerobic work
- **Volume cut:** From 13h55 → 5h55 (58% reduction)
- **Session reduction:** From 12 → 7 sessions
- **Easy pacing:** All sessions at lower end of zones
- **Technique focus:** Swim drill percentage highest (48%)
- **Sleep priority:** New Year's holiday allows extra rest
- **Mental break:** Reduced training stress before Cycle 3

**Key Adaptations:**
- Holiday timing (New Year's) aligns with recovery needs
- No testing this week (FTP/CSS/Threshold tests at Week 12)
- Strength training skipped - joints/muscles recover fully
- Swim technique refinement at relaxed pace

**Preparation for Week 9:**
- Full adaptation to Cycle 2 training load
- Fitness gains consolidated
- Ready for Cycle 3 build (Weeks 9-11)
- Fresh legs for renewed intensity work

**Holiday Notes:**
- New Year's Eve (Wed): Light training
- New Year's Day (Thu): Check pool hours, optional walk instead of morning workout

## Optional Mobility Work

**Focus:** Gentle restorative mobility (aid recovery)
**Duration:** 20 min
**Best timing:** Tuesday or Thursday evening

**Routine:**
- Gentle yoga flow (sun salutations): 5min
- Supported pigeon pose: 3min each side
- Supine hamstring stretch: 2min each leg
- Spinal twists: 2min each side
- Cat-cow: 2min
