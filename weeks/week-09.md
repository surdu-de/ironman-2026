- Updated training zones for all future workouts

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2026-01-06
- duration-actual:: 22.8
- distance-actual:: 7.18
- test-type:: FTP-ramp
- avg-power:: 152
- normalized-power:: 197
- max-power:: 343
- avg-hr:: 144
- max-hr:: 186
- avg-cadence:: 88
- max-cadence:: 111
- elevation-gain:: 142
- calories:: 198
- ftp-result:: 225
- status:: completed

**Test Protocol (Ramp Test):**

### Fri Jan 9 ✅

#### Morning/Midday: Sweet Spot + HIIT Bike - 60min
**Workout:** Rouvy "Sweet & HIT 4 | Unbound Ready" - **COMPLETED**
**Time:** Morning/Midday

**Planned:**
- Duration: 60min
- TSS: 63.0
- Zone: Z3 (Sweet Spot) + Z5 (Short HITs)
- FTP: 225W

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2026-01-09
- duration-actual:: 60.0
- distance-actual:: 25.32
- avg-power:: 167
- normalized-power:: 191
- max-avg-power-20min:: 205
- avg-hr:: 148
- max-hr:: 175
- avg-cadence:: 87
- max-cadence:: 104
- elevation-gain:: 444
- calories:: 575
- ftp:: 225
- status:: completed

**Workout Structure (32 intervals):**
- Warmup: 10min @ 105-130W
- Main work: Multiple 2-min sweet spot intervals @ 200-207W (Z3)
- HIIT surges: 8-second explosive efforts @ 435-483W (Z5)
- Recovery periods: 135W between intervals
- Cooldown: 13min progressive easy

**Notes:** **ADJUSTED FROM ORIGINAL PLAN** - Substituted for 65min easy run due to snow storm + ankle caution. Sweet spot bike better addresses load focus needs (anaerobic shortage per Garmin). Excellent execution: normalized power 191W (85% FTP), sweet spot intervals at 200-207W (89-92% FTP), explosive HITs at 435-483W. Indoor session = weather-proof + ankle-safe. Builds muscular endurance and surge responsiveness for race day.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 60min (sweet spot + HIIT bike)

### Sat Jan 10 ✅

#### Afternoon Long Run - 2h00
**Workout:** Long Easy Aerobic Run
**Time:** Flexible (afternoon)

**Planned:**
- Duration: 90-120min
- Pace: 6:30-7:00/km
- HR: 133-145 bpm (Z2)
- Distance: ~12-17km

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Run
- date:: 2026-01-10
- duration-actual:: 120.0
- distance-actual:: 18.13
- avg-pace:: 6:37
- avg-hr:: 149
- max-hr:: 161
- elevation-gain:: 74
- elevation-loss:: 61
- avg-power:: 320
- calories:: 1587
- status:: completed

**Conditions:** Heavy snow, roads not always clear. Very challenging conditions requiring constant stabilization and extra muscular effort.

**Notes:** **SWAPPED WITH SUNDAY** - Completed full 2 hours! HR was higher than Z2 target (149 vs 133-145 target) due to snow conditions - running in snow requires significantly more effort for stabilization and pushing through unstable surface. Cold weather also elevates HR. Pace was controlled and on target (6:37/km). Excellent mental toughness to complete 2h in these conditions. This was effectively a Z3 effort vs planned Z2, which will impact tomorrow's recovery.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 2h00 (long run)

---

### Sun Jan 11 ✅

HR stayed controlled at 132 bpm avg despite Saturday's harder snow run. Completed 12 laps indicating tempo block structure was followed. Duration 11min over plan (+6%) and distance exceeded target. Great recovery workout with structured intensity. Indoor trainer (Rouvy).

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 3h11 (long bike with tempo blocks)
