# Week 7: Dec 22-28, 2025 (Build Week 3 - Modified Peak)

**Focus:** Quality over quantity, Christmas week flexibility, progressive volume

**Week 7 Strategy:** After Week 6's intense testing and cumulative fatigue, Week 7 takes a smarter approach:
- Mon-Tue: Recovery days (optional swim)
- Wed-Fri: 3 quality intensity days (ONE hard session per day)
- Sat-Sun: Peak long sessions (swapped for logistics)

This is a HUGE mental and physical breakthrough after Week 6's incomplete VO2max session. Very consistent power output (242-243W). Perfect heart rate progression (150→154→159→160). Cadence slightly below target (88-91 vs 90-95) but acceptable for VO2max work. Proved you can complete the full VO2max session. Excellent preparation for weekend long sessions!

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 51min (VO2max bike - breakthrough!)

---

### Sat Dec 27 ✅

#### Long Run (No Swim) - 2h28 (148min)
**Workout:** [[long-run|Long Run - HR Target Modified]]
**Time:** Afternoon

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Run
- date:: 2025-12-27
- duration-actual:: 148.3
- distance-actual:: 25.40
- avg-pace:: 5:50/km
- avg-hr:: 147
- max-hr:: 157
- elevation-gain:: 136
- elevation-loss:: 114
- avg-power:: 369
- calories:: 2077
- status:: completed

**Pacing Analysis:**
- Km 1: 6:18/km (warmup, HR 133)
- Km 2-10: 5:33-5:52/km (settled into rhythm, HR 144-148)
- Km 11-20: 5:43-5:55/km (very consistent, HR 146-150)
- Km 21-25.4: 5:42-5:59/km (maintained effort, HR 145-150)
- Very consistent splits throughout (5:33-5:59 range)

**Notes:** STRONG LONG RUN but discipline issue. Duration on target (148min vs 150min planned). However, pace significantly faster than planned (5:50/km vs 6:30-7:00/km target) which pushed heart rate above discipline targets. Avg HR 147 bpm (vs 140-145 target), max HR 157 bpm (vs 148 cap). This became a Z2-Z3 run instead of pure Z2. Positive: Very consistent pacing, good distance (25.4km vs 20-21km), felt strong throughout. Negative: Did not follow HR discipline protocol - ran by feel/pace instead of HR cap. No morning swim (skipped).

**Key Learning:** Need to prioritize HR discipline on aerobic runs. Faster pace ≠ better training for aerobic base building. The goal was volume at low intensity, not tempo pace.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 2h28 (long run only, no swim)

### Sun Dec 28 ✅

#### Morning Long Bike (8:00-10:03) - 2h03 (123min)
**Workout:** [[z2-endurance|Z2 Long Endurance Ride - TRUE Z2]]
**Time:** 8:00-10:03

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-28
- duration-actual:: 122.7
- distance-actual:: 62.08
- avg-power:: 134
- normalized-power:: 134
- avg-hr:: 129
- max-hr:: 140
- avg-cadence:: 89
- calories:: 1182
- status:: completed

**Power & HR Analysis:**
- Lap 1 (0-10min): 127W, HR 123 (warmup)
- Laps 2-12 (10-120min): 135W steady, HR 129-132 (perfect Z2)
- Lap 13 (120-123min): 134W, HR 128 (cooldown)
- Power variability: Excellent (NP = AP = 134W)
- HR discipline: Perfect (129 avg, 140 max vs 130-140 target)

**Notes:** EXCELLENT POWER DISCIPLINE! **Finally achieved TRUE Z2 riding** at 134W (vs 120-140W target = perfect execution). This is a HUGE improvement from Week 6's 165W mistake. NP = AP = 134W shows incredibly consistent pacing. Heart rate spot-on (129 avg vs 130-140 target). However, ride significantly shortened: 2h03 vs 3h15 planned (-72min, 63% of planned duration). Distance: 62km vs 105-110km planned. Likely cut short due to weather, time constraints, or cumulative fatigue from week.

**Key Success:** Power discipline achieved! This is the aerobic base building intensity that was intended. Much smarter execution than Week 6.

**Volume Gap:** -72min is significant. This was supposed to be the peak long ride. Weather/logistics/fatigue likely factors.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 2h03 (Z2 bike - shortened but perfect intensity)

## Week 7 Performance Summary

### Quality Work Execution: **A-**

**Intensity Sessions - EXCELLENT:**
1. ✅ **Wed Threshold Run:** 5x5min @ 4:31-4:42/km (EXCEEDED plan - 25min vs 20min)
2. ✅ **Thu Sweet Spot Bike:** 3x10min @ 184W (PERFECT execution - 99.5% of target)
3. ✅ **Fri VO2max Bike:** 4x3min @ 243W (BREAKTHROUGH - completed all intervals at 110% FTP!)

**Quality Achievement:** All three key intensity sessions completed perfectly. The Friday VO2max completion is a significant breakthrough after Week 6's incomplete session.

### Endurance Work: **B-**

**Successes:**
- ✅ **Sun Z2 Bike:** PERFECT power discipline (134W vs 120-140W target)
- ✅ **Sat Long Run:** Duration on target (148min vs 150min)

**Discipline Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Sat Long Run:** Failed HR discipline (147 avg, 157 max vs 148 cap) - ran too fast (5:50/km vs 6:30-7:00)
- ⚠️ **Sun Z2 Bike:** Cut short (123min vs 195min = -72min)
- ❌ **Sat Swim:** Skipped VO2max swim session

### Volume Completion: **C+**

**By Discipline:**
- **Swim:** 53% (1 session, 53min vs 2 sessions, 100min)
- **Bike:** 51% (3 sessions, 229min vs 4 sessions, 445min)
- **Run:** 98% (2 sessions, 205min vs 2 sessions, 210min)
- **Overall:** 63% (487min vs 775min)

**Primary Volume Gaps:**
1. Sunday bike shortened by 72min (weather/fatigue)
2. Saturday swim skipped (60min)
3. Efficiency in quality sessions (shorter warmups/cooldowns)

### Key Wins

1. **VO2max Breakthrough:** Completed all 4x3min @ 243W after Week 6 failure
2. **Threshold Progression:** 5x5min intervals (vs Week 6's 4x4min) with perfect pacing
3. **Power Discipline Achieved:** Sunday bike at 134W (true Z2) vs Week 6's 165W mistake
4. **Christmas Week Balance:** Quality work completed while maintaining family flexibility

### Areas for Improvement

1. **HR Discipline on Long Runs:** Must cap HR at 148 for aerobic base building (ran 5:50/km instead of 6:30-7:00/km)
2. **Volume Completion:** 63% completion - need to hit full duration on endurance sessions
3. **Swim Consistency:** Only 1 swim completed, missing VO2max session
4. **Long Bike Duration:** Cut 72min short - weather/logistics planning needed

### Week 7 vs Week 6 ACTUAL Comparison

| Metric | Week 6 Actual | Week 7 Actual | Change |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Total Time | 12h02 | 8h07 | -235min (-33%) |
| Swim | 1h54 (2900m) | 0h53 (1525m) | -61min, -1375m |
| Bike | 6h21 (193km) | 3h49 (115km) | -152min, -78km |
| Run | 3h47 (36.3km) | 3h25 (35.8km) | -22min, -0.5km |
| Sessions | 8 | 6 | -2 |

**Analysis:** Significant volume reduction (-33%) primarily in bike and swim. Run volume maintained well (98%). Quality intensity work excellent, but endurance volume cut short.

### Overall Grade: **B+**

**Rationale:**
- Intensity execution: A- (all quality sessions completed well, VO2max breakthrough)
- Endurance discipline: B- (power discipline achieved, but HR discipline failed and volume cut short)
- Volume completion: C+ (63% of planned duration)
- Christmas context: Week succeeded in maintaining quality while accommodating family time

**Christmas Week Context:** Volume gaps understandable given holiday period. The critical win was completing all quality intensity work and achieving power discipline on the Z2 bike. Week 8 (recovery) provides opportunity to reset before Week 9 build resumes.

**Week 7 Philosophy - Quality Over Quantity:**

After Week 6's intense load and mid-week fatigue, Week 7 takes a strategic approach:

**Recovery First (Mon-Tue):**
- Complete rest Monday
- Optional easy swim Tuesday (no pressure)
- Arrive at Wednesday quality work refreshed

**Single Focus Days (Wed-Fri):**
- ONE hard session per day (no doubles)
- Maximum recovery between efforts
- Fresh for each quality workout
- Christmas week family flexibility

**Peak Volume Weekend (Sat-Sun):**
- Swapped schedule for logistics
- Saturday: VO2max swim (arm-focused) + 2h30 run @ 148 HR cap
- Sunday: 3h15 bike @ TRUE Z2 (120-140W)

**Progression from Week 6:**
- Total volume: +53min (+7.3%) - modest increase
- BUT: Arriving more rested (Mon-Tue recovery)
- Quality work: 20min threshold + 30min Sweet Spot + 12min VO2max = 62min
- Week 6 quality: 20min threshold + 30min tempo + 10.5min VO2max = 60.5min
- Nearly identical intensity volume, but better distributed

**Key Sessions:**
1. **Wednesday threshold run** (4x5min @ 4:30-4:40/km) - proving 5min intervals
2. **Friday VO2max bike** (4x3min @ 231W) - proving 4 intervals completion
3. **Saturday long run** (2h30 @ 148 HR cap) - peak run volume with discipline
4. **Sunday long bike** (3h15 @ 120-140W) - peak bike volume with TRUE Z2 discipline

**Christmas Week Flexibility:**
- Each hard day = 1-2h training, rest of day FREE
- Tuesday optional (coordinate with Dragos)
- Single sessions allow family obligations
- Training done early or midday, evenings free

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Power discipline Sunday:** 120-140W (set alerts!) - not 165W like Week 6
2. **HR discipline Saturday:** 148 bpm cap on run - aerobic base building
3. **Complete Friday VO2max:** All 4x3min intervals - mental & physical goal
4. **Recovery quality:** Sleep, nutrition, hydration during Christmas week

**Week 7 vs Week 6 Comparison:**

| Metric | Week 6 | Week 7 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total Time | 12h02 | 12h55 | +53min (+7%) |
| Swim | 1h54 (2900m) | 1h40 (3450m) | -14min, +550m |
| Bike | 6h21 (193km) | 7h25 (195km) | +64min, +2km |
| Run | 3h47 (36.3km) | 3h30 (42km) | -17min, +5.7km |
| Quality Work | 60.5min | 62min | +1.5min |
| Hard Days | Tue+Thu (doubles) | Wed+Thu+Fri (singles) | Better distributed |
| Long Bike | 3h00 @ 164W | 3h15 @ 130W | +15min, LOWER intensity |
| Long Run | 2h15 (hilly 513m) | 2h30 (HR cap 148) | +15min, controlled |

**Swim Strategy Shift:**
- Week 6: 3 sessions planned, 2 completed, reduced volume due to fatigue
- Week 7: 2 sessions planned, both PURPOSE-DRIVEN
  - Tuesday: Optional easy technique (flexible)
  - Saturday: VO2max with arm focus (strategic before run)
- Total volume UP (+550m) with fewer sessions = better quality

**The "Single Focus Day" Advantage:**
- Wednesday: Fresh legs for threshold run (not tired from Tuesday doubles)
- Thursday: 24h recovery from Wednesday before Sweet Spot
- Friday: 24h recovery before VO2max (not same day as run)
- Saturday: 25h recovery from Friday VO2max before long run
- Sunday: Fresh for 3h15 Z2 bike (run is ~48h prior)

**Week 7 Grade Prediction:** If executed as planned:
- Complete all quality sessions = **A**
- Hit power/HR discipline targets = **A+**
- Skip sessions or fail discipline = **B+**

The key is NOT volume, but EXECUTION of quality work and Z2 discipline.
