# Week 7: Dec 22-28, 2025 (Build Week 3 - Modified Peak)

**Focus:** Quality over quantity, Christmas week flexibility, progressive volume

**Week 7 Strategy:** After Week 6's intense testing and cumulative fatigue, Week 7 takes a smarter approach:
- Mon-Tue: Recovery days (optional swim)
- Wed-Fri: 3 quality intensity days (ONE hard session per day)
- Sat-Sun: Peak long sessions (swapped for logistics)

**Activities:**
- Complete physical rest
- Optional: Light stretching, foam rolling
- Mental preparation for Week 7
- Family time

**Daily Total:** 0 sessions (REST)

---

### Tue Dec 23 ⬜

#### Optional Easy Swim (Evening 19:00-19:40) - 40min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/swim/drill-heavy-technique|Drill-Heavy Technique]]
**Time:** 19:00-19:40
**Status:** FLEXIBLE - coordinate with Dragos

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 200m easy
- Drill Set: 8x50m @ 1:20 (sculling, catch-up, fist drill, single-arm)
- Pull Buoy Set: 3x100m @ 2:35/100m, 25s rest
- Continuous: 200m smooth @ 2:40/100m

**Daily Total:** 0-1 sessions, 0-40min (flexible easy swim)

---

### Wed Dec 24 ⬜ (Christmas Eve)

#### Morning Run (6:15-7:15) - 60min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/run/threshold-intervals|Threshold Intervals - 4x5min @ Z4]]
**Time:** 6:15-7:15

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 15min easy build
- Main Set: **4x5min @ Z4 (4:30-4:40/km, 165-170 HR)**
- Recovery: 3min jog between intervals
- Cooldown: 10min easy
- **Total: 60min**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Run
- duration-planned:: 60
- distance-planned:: 10-11
- zone-target:: Z4 Threshold
- avg-hr-target:: 165-170
- pace-target:: 4:30-4:40/km

**Notes:** KEY SESSION - Same threshold volume as Week 6 (20min), but longer intervals (5min vs 4min). Week 6 you ran 4:27-4:35/km @ 166-171 HR. Target similar pace. HR will likely rise higher with 5min intervals. Done by 7:15am - rest of day FREE for Christmas Eve family time.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 1h (threshold run only)

---

### Thu Dec 25 ⬜ (Christmas Day)

#### Midday Bike (12:00-13:30) - 90min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/bike/sweetspot|Sweet Spot Intervals - 3x10min @ 84% FTP]]
**Time:** 12:00-13:30

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 20min progressive (Z1→Z2)
- Main Set: **3x10min @ 185W (84% FTP, Sweet Spot)**
- Recovery: 5min easy spin between intervals
- Cooldown: 10min easy
- **Total: 90min**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 90
- distance-planned:: 45
- zone-target:: Z3-Z4 Sweet Spot
- avg-power-target:: 185
- np-target:: 185
- avg-cadence-target:: 90-95

**Notes:** Sweet Spot work (84% FTP) - harder than Week 6 tempo (176W @ 80% FTP) but much easier than original 237W anaerobic plan. Week 6 you held 165W for 3 hours, so 185W for 3x10min should be challenging but achievable (RPE 6-7/10). Indoor trainer. ONE session on Christmas Day = rest of day with family.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 1h30 (Sweet Spot bike only)

---

### Fri Dec 26 ⬜ (Boxing Day)

#### Morning Bike (6:30-7:30) - 60min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/bike/vo2max-intervals|VO2max Intervals - 4x3min @ 105% FTP]]
**Time:** 6:30-7:30

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 20min progressive, include 3x1min @ Z3 efforts
- Main Set: **4x3min @ 231W (105% FTP, VO2max)**
- Recovery: **3min very easy spin** between intervals
- Cooldown: 10min easy
- **Total: 60min**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 60
- distance-planned:: 30
- zone-target:: Z5 VO2max
- avg-power-target:: 231
- np-target:: 231
- avg-cadence-target:: 90-95

**Notes:** KEY VO2MAX SESSION - Week 6 you completed 3x3min @ 228-230W successfully, but failed on intervals 4-5. This session proves you can complete all 4 intervals. Mental goal: finish strong. Indoor trainer required. Done by 7:30am - prep for weekend long sessions.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 1h (VO2max bike only)

---

### Sat Dec 27 ⬜

#### Morning Swim (9:00-10:00) - 60min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/swim/vo2max-intervals-2200m|VO2max Intervals - 3x300m (Arm-Focused)]]
**Time:** 9:00-10:00

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 400m easy build
- Drill Set: 6x50m @ 1:15 (technique prep)
- **Main Set: 3x300m @ 2:25/100m (T4 pace), 90s rest**
  - **USE HAND PADDLES + PULL BUOY** (arm focus, save legs for run)
- Pull Buoy Continuous: 300m @ 2:40/100m
- Cooldown: 200m
- **Total: 2050m**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Swim
- duration-planned:: 60
- distance-planned:: 2050
- zone-target:: T4-T5 VO2max
- pace-target:: 2:25/100m (main set)
- equipment:: Hand paddles + pull buoy

**Notes:** VO2max swim with arm focus. Hand paddles + pull buoy keeps legs fresh for 2h30 run afterward. Reduced from 4x300m to 3x300m and increased rest to 90s for better recovery. Main set = 900m hard swimming.

#### Afternoon Long Run (14:00-16:30) - 2h30 (150min)
**Workout:** [[../workouts/run/long-run|Long Run Z2 - HR Capped @ 148 bpm]]
**Time:** 14:00-16:30

**Structure:**
- Continuous steady effort
- **CRITICAL: HR capped at 148 bpm maximum**
- Pace will vary based on HR cap (likely 6:30-7:00/km)
- HR: 135-148 bpm

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Run
- duration-planned:: 150
- distance-planned:: 20-21
- zone-target:: Z2 (HR-controlled)
- avg-hr-target:: 140-145
- max-hr-limit:: 148
- pace-target:: Variable (HR-driven, likely 6:30-7:00/km)

**Notes:** PEAK LONG RUN - +15min from Week 6's 2h15. HR capped at 148 bpm ensures true aerobic work. This is VOLUME building, not intensity. Pace slower than Week 6's hilly run, but duration longer. Practice race nutrition (gels at 50min, 90min, 130min). 3h30 after swim - adequate recovery. Week 6's 2h15 had 513m elevation gain; this should be flatter terrain to maintain HR discipline.

**Daily Total:** 2 sessions, 3h30 (VO2max swim + long run) - BIG DAY

### Sun Dec 28 ⬜

#### Morning Long Bike (8:00-11:15) - 3h15 (195min)
**Workout:** [[../workouts/bike/z2-endurance|Z2 Long Endurance Ride - TRUE Z2]]
**Time:** 8:00-11:15

**Structure:**
- 15min warmup
- 2h45 steady Z2 @ **120-140W (TRUE Z2 - NOT 165W!)**
- Include 5x5min @ 100 rpm cadence work (spread throughout)
- 15min cooldown
- **Total: 195min (3h15), ~105-110km**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 195
- distance-planned:: 105-110
- zone-target:: Z2
- avg-power-target:: 120-140
- max-power-alert:: 145 (set alert!)
- avg-hr-target:: 130-140
- avg-cadence-target:: 90+

**Notes:** PEAK LONG BIKE - +15min from Week 6's 3h00. CRITICAL POWER DISCIPLINE: Week 6 you rode 165W (75% FTP) for 3h at RPE 7/10. This week target 120-140W (55-64% FTP) for true Z2 aerobic base building. Set power alerts at 145W maximum. This should feel EASIER than Week 6 (RPE 4-5/10), but longer duration. The goal is aerobic efficiency and fat adaptation, not fitness testing. Outdoor Hamburg course if weather permits. Nutrition: 60g carbs/hour (practice Ironman fueling - 3h15 = ~195g carbs total).

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 3h15 (long Z2 bike) - PEAK LONG RIDE

## Week Completion

**Progress:** ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ (0/7 days completed)

**Week 7 Status: Planned - MODIFIED PEAK**
- Sessions planned: 8-10 (depends on Tue swim)
- Sessions completed: 0
- Total planned duration: 12h55 (vs 13h30 original)

**Week 7 Philosophy - Quality Over Quantity:**

After Week 6's intense load and mid-week fatigue, Week 7 takes a strategic approach:

**Recovery First (Mon-Tue):**
- Complete rest Monday
- Optional easy swim Tuesday (no pressure)
- Arrive at Wednesday quality work refreshed

**Single Focus Days (Wed-Fri):**
- ONE hard session per day (no doubles)
- Maximum recovery between efforts
- Fresh for each quality workout
- Christmas week family flexibility

**Peak Volume Weekend (Sat-Sun):**
- Swapped schedule for logistics
- Saturday: VO2max swim (arm-focused) + 2h30 run @ 148 HR cap
- Sunday: 3h15 bike @ TRUE Z2 (120-140W)

**Progression from Week 6:**
- Total volume: +53min (+7.3%) - modest increase
- BUT: Arriving more rested (Mon-Tue recovery)
- Quality work: 20min threshold + 30min Sweet Spot + 12min VO2max = 62min
- Week 6 quality: 20min threshold + 30min tempo + 10.5min VO2max = 60.5min
- Nearly identical intensity volume, but better distributed

**Key Sessions:**
1. **Wednesday threshold run** (4x5min @ 4:30-4:40/km) - proving 5min intervals
2. **Friday VO2max bike** (4x3min @ 231W) - proving 4 intervals completion
3. **Saturday long run** (2h30 @ 148 HR cap) - peak run volume with discipline
4. **Sunday long bike** (3h15 @ 120-140W) - peak bike volume with TRUE Z2 discipline

**Christmas Week Flexibility:**
- Each hard day = 1-2h training, rest of day FREE
- Tuesday optional (coordinate with Dragos)
- Single sessions allow family obligations
- Training done early or midday, evenings free

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Power discipline Sunday:** 120-140W (set alerts!) - not 165W like Week 6
2. **HR discipline Saturday:** 148 bpm cap on run - aerobic base building
3. **Complete Friday VO2max:** All 4x3min intervals - mental & physical goal
4. **Recovery quality:** Sleep, nutrition, hydration during Christmas week

**Week 7 vs Week 6 Comparison:**

| Metric | Week 6 | Week 7 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total Time | 12h02 | 12h55 | +53min (+7%) |
| Swim | 1h54 (2900m) | 1h40 (3450m) | -14min, +550m |
| Bike | 6h21 (193km) | 7h25 (195km) | +64min, +2km |
| Run | 3h47 (36.3km) | 3h30 (42km) | -17min, +5.7km |
| Quality Work | 60.5min | 62min | +1.5min |
| Hard Days | Tue+Thu (doubles) | Wed+Thu+Fri (singles) | Better distributed |
| Long Bike | 3h00 @ 164W | 3h15 @ 130W | +15min, LOWER intensity |
| Long Run | 2h15 (hilly 513m) | 2h30 (HR cap 148) | +15min, controlled |

**Swim Strategy Shift:**
- Week 6: 3 sessions planned, 2 completed, reduced volume due to fatigue
- Week 7: 2 sessions planned, both PURPOSE-DRIVEN
  - Tuesday: Optional easy technique (flexible)
  - Saturday: VO2max with arm focus (strategic before run)
- Total volume UP (+550m) with fewer sessions = better quality

**The "Single Focus Day" Advantage:**
- Wednesday: Fresh legs for threshold run (not tired from Tuesday doubles)
- Thursday: 24h recovery from Wednesday before Sweet Spot
- Friday: 24h recovery before VO2max (not same day as run)
- Saturday: 25h recovery from Friday VO2max before long run
- Sunday: Fresh for 3h15 Z2 bike (run is ~48h prior)

**Week 7 Grade Prediction:** If executed as planned:
- Complete all quality sessions = **A**
- Hit power/HR discipline targets = **A+**
- Skip sessions or fail discipline = **B+**

The key is NOT volume, but EXECUTION of quality work and Z2 discipline.
