## Detailed Workouts

### Mon Dec 8 ⬜
**Rest Day** - Mandatory recovery

---

### Tue Dec 9 ⬜

#### Morning Run (6:15-7:15) - 60min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/run/threshold-intervals|Threshold Intervals - 5x4min @ Z4]]
**Time:** 6:15-7:15

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 10min easy (Z1-Z2)
- Main Set: 5x4min @ Z4 threshold (160-165 bpm, ~4:50/km pace)
- Recovery: 3min easy jog between intervals
- Cooldown: 10min easy

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Run
- duration-planned:: 60
- distance-planned:: 9
- zone-target:: Z4 Threshold
- avg-hr-target:: 162-165
- pace-target:: 4:45-4:55/km

**Notes:** First VO2max/threshold run session of Cycle 2. Start conservatively - first interval should feel 7/10, build to 8/10 by last interval. Recovery jogs should allow HR to drop below 140 bpm. Quality over quantity.

#### Lunch Bike (12:15-13:30) - 75min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/bike/anaerobic-sweetspot|Anaerobic Intervals - 3x8min @ 106% FTP]]
**Time:** 12:15-13:30

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 15min progressive (Z1→Z2)
- Main Set: 3x8min @ 234W (106% FTP)
- Recovery: 5min very easy spin (Z1, 80-100W) between intervals
- Cooldown: 15min easy

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 75
- distance-planned:: 40
- zone-target:: Z4-Z5 Anaerobic
- avg-power-target:: 234
- np-target:: 234
- avg-cadence-target:: 90-95

**Notes:** This is your weekly anaerobic bike session. Indoor trainer REQUIRED for precision. These are HARD but sustainable - not sprints. Each 8min interval should feel like 8/10 effort. Lock into 234W and hold steady. This builds power above threshold and supports FTP gains.

#### Evening Swim (20:30-21:15) - 45min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/swim/drill-heavy-technique|Drill-Heavy Technique + Pull Buoy]]
**Time:** 20:30-21:15

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 200m easy freestyle
- Drill Set (40%): 8x50m @ 1:20
  - 2x catch-up (extension, timing)
  - 2x fist drill (forearm awareness)
  - 2x single-arm (stroke completion)
  - 2x fingertip drag (high elbow)
- Pull Buoy Set: 4x100m @ 2:35/100m, 20s rest
  - Focus: High elbow catch, vertical forearm
  - No legs - isolate upper body only
- Cooldown: 100m easy
- **Total: 1500m**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Swim
- duration-planned:: 45
- distance-planned:: 1500
- zone-target:: Z1-Z2 Technique
- pace-target:: 2:35-2:40/100m
- drill-percentage:: 53

**Notes:** 53% technique work (40% drills + 20% pull buoy). Pull buoy set isolates catch and pull mechanics - this is your technique priority for improving catch and pull power.

**Daily Total:** 3 sessions, 3h (threshold run + anaerobic bike + technique swim)

## Week Completion

**Progress:** ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ (0/7 days completed)

**Week 5 Status: Planned**
- Sessions planned: 10
- Sessions completed: 0
- Total planned duration: 11h20

**Key Sessions This Week:**
1. Tuesday anaerobic bike (3x8min @ 234W) - NEW workout type
2. Thursday VO2max bike (4x3min @ 231W) - Custom medium intervals
3. Saturday long bike (2h30, 85km)
4. Sunday long run (110min, 16-17km)
5. Tuesday threshold run (5x4min @ Z4)

**Swim Technique Focus:**
- Total drill volume: ~1850m (38% of 4800m)
- Pull buoy work: ~700m (14% of 4800m)
- Combined technique emphasis: 52%

**Constraints Verified:**
- ✅ Monday rest day
- ✅ Thursday swim 20:00-21:00
- ✅ No back-to-back swim days (Tue/Thu/Sun spacing)
- ✅ School drop-off 7:45 accommodated
- ✅ School pickup times respected (Wed 16:00)
- ✅ Onsite Tue/Thu gym access utilized

**Intensity Distribution:**
- Hard days: Tue (run threshold + bike anaerobic), Thu (bike VO2max + swim threshold)
- Moderate days: Wed (easy sessions), Sat (long bike), Sun (long run)
- Easy day: Fri (easy run only)
- Rest: Mon

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Volume increase modest from Week 4 recovery (+7-8h)
- Swim sessions locked in (Tue/Thu/Sun) - no back-to-back days
- Easy days properly easy (Friday especially light)
- Progressive loading - not exceeding Week 3 mistake

---

## Optional Mobility Work

**Focus:** Hip flexor and hamstring mobility (cycling + running load increasing)
**Duration:** 20-30 min
**Best timing:** Friday evening or Sunday evening after long sessions

**Routine:**
- Hip flexor stretches (couch stretch): 2min each side
- Hamstring flossing: 2x10 each leg
- Pigeon pose: 2min each side
- Cat-cow spine mobility: 2min
- Thoracic rotations: 2x10 each side
- Calf stretching: 2min each leg
- Foam roll IT bands, quads, calves: 5-8min

**Benefits:** Maintains range of motion as training volume increases, particularly targeting areas that tighten from cycling position and running load.
