**Next Steps:**
- **Cycle 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Build on new FTP/CSS/Threshold zones
- Use test results to update training-zones.md
- Plan next 4-week block with updated power/pace targets
- Continue bike performance focus with higher baseline powers

## Optional Mobility Work

**Focus:** Pre-test mobility and recovery (optimize testing performance)
**Duration:** 20 min
**Best timing:** Monday evening, Thursday evening (between tests)

**Routine:**
- Gentle full-body stretching: 8min
- Hip openers (low lunge variations): 3min
- Hamstring flossing: 2min
- Shoulder + thoracic mobility: 3min
- Spinal twists + cat-cow: 2min
- Light foam rolling (avoid deep tissue): 2min

**Benefits:** Light mobility work optimizes testing performance without creating muscle soreness. Monday evening aids recovery from Week 11 peak. Thursday evening (between FTP and run tests) maintains mobility without compromising fresh legs for testing.
