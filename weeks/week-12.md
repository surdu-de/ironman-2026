# Week 12: Jan 26 - Feb 1, 2026 (Recovery Week)

**Focus:** True recovery from Cycle 3 overreach, run threshold test, prepare for Cycle 4

## Week Overview
|              | Swim   | Bike   | Run     | Total  |
|--------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Sessions** | 1      | 1      | 1       | 3      |
| **Time**     | 0h50   | 0h45   | 0h50    | 2h25   |
| **Distance** | 1800m  | 25km   | 7km     | -      |

**Volume Reduction:** ~77% vs Week 11 actual (~10h40)

**Context:** Week 10 overreach (+25% volume at 15h40) caused Week 11 fatigue (Tuesday session failure, needed Monday rest). Garmin data shows acute training load at ceiling (~1750-1800), low aerobic overloaded, anaerobic deficit. This week prioritizes true recovery to start Cycle 4 in optimal condition.

**Travel:** Out of country Friday evening through Sunday.

## Detailed Workouts

### Mon Jan 26 ⬜
**Rest Day** - Full recovery after Sunday's 4h bike (89km + 36km)

---

### Tue Jan 27 ⬜
**Rest Day** - Second rest day to drop acute training load before Wednesday test

---

### Wed Jan 28 ⬜

#### Morning Run Threshold Test - 50min
**Workout:** Run Threshold Test - 30min Protocol
**Time:** Morning (flexible)

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 15min easy progressive build
- Main Test: 30min ALL-OUT sustainable pace
  - Start conservatively at ~4:40/km
  - Settle into rhythm by 5min mark
  - Push final 10min
- Cooldown: 5min walk/very easy jog

**Current Threshold:** 171 bpm LTHR, 4:48/km pace
**Target:** Improve to ~4:35-4:45/km

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Run
- duration-planned:: 50
- distance-planned:: 6.5-7.5
- zone-target:: Z4-Z5 Test
- test-type:: Threshold

**Notes:** CRITICAL TEST. Fresh legs after 2 full rest days. Use flat route. Average HR from 30min effort = new LTHR. Average pace = new threshold pace. This establishes run training zones for Cycle 4.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 50min (threshold test)

---

### Thu Jan 29 ⬜

#### Evening Swim (20:00-20:50) - 50min
**Workout:** Easy Technique Swim
**Time:** 20:00-20:50

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 300m easy
- Drill Set (40%): 10x50m @ 1:30 (extra rest)
  - 3x catch-up
  - 3x fist drill
  - 2x single-arm
  - 2x fingertip drag
- Pull Buoy: 4x100m @ 2:35/100m, 25s rest
- Continuous: 200m smooth
- Cooldown: 100m very easy
- **Total: 1800m**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Swim
- duration-planned:: 50
- distance-planned:: 1800
- zone-target:: Z1-Z2
- drill-percentage:: 45

**Notes:** Fixed Thursday 20:00 slot. Easy technique session - no intensity. Focus on smooth, relaxed swimming. Recovery session, not a workout.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 50min (easy technique swim)

---

### Fri Jan 30 ⬜

#### Morning Bike (06:30-07:15) - 45min
**Workout:** FTP Tickle - Short Intensity Stimulus
**Time:** 06:30-07:15 (before travel)

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 10min progressive (100W → 150W)
- Openers: 3x30s @ 130% FTP (286W) / 30s easy spin
  - Addresses anaerobic deficit
- Main Set: 3x3min @ 105% FTP (231W)
  - 3min easy spin between intervals
  - RPE 8/10 (hard but not maximal)
  - High cadence: 95-100 rpm
- Cooldown: 8min very easy

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 45
- distance-planned:: 24-26
- zone-target:: Z4-Z5 (intervals only)
- np-target:: 165-175
- avg-power-target:: 140-150

**Notes:** Short intensity session to maintain FTP stimulus without fatigue debt. The 30s sprints address anaerobic deficit (Garmin Load Focus showed 747, below optimal). Total hard work: ~12 minutes. Indoor trainer required. Done before leaving for travel.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 45min (FTP tickle)

---

### Sat Jan 31 ⬜
**Rest Day** - Out of country (travel)

Optional: Easy 30-40min walk/jog to explore if desired.

---

### Sun Feb 1 ⬜
**Rest Day** - Out of country (travel)

## Week Completion

**Progress:** ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ (0/7 days completed)

**Week 12 Status: Planned - TRUE RECOVERY WEEK**
- Sessions planned: 3
- Sessions completed: 0
- Total planned duration: 2h25
- Rest days: 4 (Mon, Tue, Sat, Sun)

**Recovery Week Design Rationale:**

1. **Two rest days at start** - Drop acute training load from ceiling (~1750-1800) back to mid-optimal range

2. **Run threshold test Wednesday** - Fresh legs after 48h rest gives best test data for Cycle 4 zones

3. **Easy swim Thursday** - Technique maintenance at fixed slot, no intensity

4. **FTP tickle Friday morning** - Short intensity stimulus before travel:
   - Maintains FTP without full test fatigue
   - 30s sprints address anaerobic deficit
   - 3x3min @ 105% gives VO2max tickle
   - Done by 7:15, clear for travel

5. **Weekend rest** - Travel days, no training required

**Garmin Data Context (entering this week):**
- Acute Training Load: ~1750-1800 (at ceiling)
- Low Aerobic: 2077 (above optimal - overloaded)
- High Aerobic: 1786 (at optimal ceiling)
- Anaerobic: 747 (below optimal - deficit)
- HRV Status: Balanced

**Expected outcomes by end of Week 12:**
- Acute load dropped to ~1200-1400 (mid-optimal)
- Low aerobic reduced (less Z2 volume)
- Anaerobic slightly improved (Friday sprints)
- HRV maintained balanced
- Fresh and ready for Cycle 4

## Cycle 3 Summary

**Weeks 9-12 Complete.** Key outcomes:

| Metric | Start of Cycle 3 | End of Cycle 3 | Change |
|--------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| FTP | 220W | 220W (test Week 4) | Maintain |
| Run Threshold | 4:48/km | TBD (Wed test) | Expected improvement |
| CSS | 2:27/100m | 2:19-2:27 | Improved |
| Long Bike | 2h30 | 4h03 (Week 11) | +65% |
| Long Run | 1h50 | 2h30 (Week 11) | +36% |

**Key learnings for Cycle 4:**
1. Cap weekly volume at 12h (15h+ causes next-week fatigue)
2. 2 swims/week maximum (life constraint accepted)
3. No long session extensions when feeling good
4. Address anaerobic deficit with short sprint work
5. Use Garmin Load Focus and HRV as daily guides

## Next: Cycle 4 (Weeks 13-16)

**Cycle 4 Goals:**
- Peak long bike: 160km
- Weekly ceiling: 12h
- Swim: 2 sessions/week
- Intensity: Mixed (short sprints + sustained threshold)
- Start: February 2, 2026
