## Detailed Workouts

### Mon Dec 15 ✅

#### Evening Swim (19:00-19:40) - 40min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/swim/drill-heavy-technique|Drill-Heavy Technique]]
**Time:** 19:00-19:40

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 200m easy
- Drill Set (45%): 8x50m @ 1:20
  - 2x sculling (forearm feel)
  - 2x catch-up
  - 2x fist drill
  - 2x single-arm
- Pull Buoy Set: 3x100m @ 2:35/100m, 25s rest
- Continuous: 200m smooth @ 2:40/100m
- Cooldown: 100m
- **Total: 1400m**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Swim
- duration-planned:: 40
- distance-planned:: 1400
- zone-target:: Z1-Z2
- pace-target:: 2:35-2:40/100m
- drill-percentage:: 57

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Swim
- date:: 2025-12-16
- duration-actual:: 55.53
- distance-actual:: 1500
- avg-hr:: 130
- avg-pace:: 2:26/100m
- status:: completed

**Notes:** 57% technique focus (45% drills + 21% pull buoy). School pickup at 18:30, allows time for swim after pickup.

**Performance Analysis:** Exceeded all targets! Duration was 55:32 vs planned 40 minutes (139% of target, +15min). Distance was 1500m vs 1400m planned (107% of target). Most impressively, pace of 2:26/100m was 9-14 seconds FASTER than the 2:35-2:40/100m target for a drill-heavy technique session. This indicates either: (1) excellent swim fitness, (2) workout included more continuous swimming than planned drills, or (3) strong technique translating to speed. HR of 130 bpm was appropriate for Z1-Z2 work. Great session!

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 40min (drill swim)

---

### Tue Dec 16 ✅

#### Morning Run (6:15-7:15) - 60min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/run/threshold-intervals|Threshold Intervals - 5x4min @ Faster Pace]]
**Time:** 6:15-7:15

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 15min easy (Z1-Z2)
- Main Set: 5x4min @ Z4 threshold - **TARGET: 4:35-4:40/km pace**
- Recovery: 3min easy jog between intervals
- Cooldown: 10min easy

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Run
- duration-planned:: 60
- distance-planned:: 10-11
- zone-target:: Z4 Threshold
- avg-hr-target:: 170-175 (testing if faster pace drives HR higher)
- pace-target:: 4:35-4:40/km (faster than Week 5's 4:42-4:48)

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Run
- date:: 2025-12-17
- duration-actual:: 60.03
- distance-actual:: 10.38
- avg-hr:: 151
- max-hr:: 179
- avg-pace:: 5:47/km
- status:: completed

**Interval Splits:**
- Interval 1: 4:34/km @ 166 HR
- Interval 2: 4:29/km @ 171 HR
- Interval 3: 4:27/km @ 171 HR
- Interval 4: 4:34/km @ 170 HR
- Interval 5: 4:35/km @ 171 HR

**Notes:** KEY SESSION - Testing faster threshold pace than Week 5. Week 5 you ran 4:42-4:48/km @ 164-166 HR. Today we're pushing 4:35-4:40/km to see if HR reaches 170-175 target zone. This calibrates your actual threshold HR. Start first interval aggressively - trust the pace. Warmup is critical for these faster intervals.

**Performance Analysis:** Nailed the target pace! Intervals averaged 4:27-4:35/km, right in the 4:35-4:40/km target zone. However, HR during intervals (166-171 bpm) didn't reach the expected 170-175 zone - staying 4-9 bpm lower than target despite faster pace than Week 5. This suggests either: (1) improved fitness/efficiency, or (2) threshold HR may be lower than 170-175 estimate. Average HR of 151 bpm reflects warmup/cooldown periods. Excellent execution on pacing!

#### Lunch Bike (12:15-13:30) - 75min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/bike/tempo-intervals|Tempo Intervals - 3x10min @ Z3]]
**Time:** 12:15-13:30

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 15min progressive (Z1→Z2)
- Main Set: 3x10min @ 155W (70% FTP, upper Z2/low Z3)
- Recovery: 5min easy spin between intervals
- Cooldown: 10min easy

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 75
- distance-planned:: 40
- zone-target:: Z3 Tempo
- avg-power-target:: 150-160
- np-target:: 155
- avg-cadence-target:: 90-95

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-17
- duration-actual:: 75.05
- distance-actual:: 39.35
- avg-hr:: 130
- max-hr:: 152
- avg-power:: 141
- np:: 151
- avg-cadence:: 84
- status:: completed

**Interval Splits:**
- Interval 1: 176W @ 140 HR, 87 rpm
- Interval 2: 176W @ 143 HR, 87 rpm
- Interval 3: 176W @ 143 HR, 81 rpm

**Notes:** Tempo work builds aerobic capacity without deep fatigue. Less intense than anaerobic day last week. Indoor trainer. Moderate effort - RPE 6-7/10.

**Performance Analysis:** Good execution on power output - intervals at 176W exceeded the 155W target (114% of target). NP of 151W was right on target. HR during intervals (140-143 bpm) was appropriate for tempo work. Cadence averaged 84 rpm, slightly below the 90-95 target - consider focusing on maintaining higher cadence during future tempo sessions. Overall avg power of 141W reflects the warmup/cooldown periods.

**Daily Total:** 2 sessions, 2h15 (threshold run + tempo bike)

### Wed Dec 18 ⚠️

#### Morning Bike (6:30-7:45) - 75min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/bike/z2-endurance|Z2 Endurance Ride]]
**Time:** 6:30-7:45

**Structure:**
- 10min warmup
- 60min steady Z2 (120-135W)
- 5min cooldown

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 75
- distance-planned:: 40
- zone-target:: Z2
- avg-power-target:: 125-135
- avg-hr-target:: 130-140

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-18
- duration-actual:: 70.07
- distance-actual:: 35.11
- avg-hr:: 124
- max-hr:: 143
- avg-power:: 123
- np:: 128
- avg-cadence:: 79
- status:: completed

**Notes:** Easy Z2 ride. Indoor session before work.

**Performance Analysis:** Solid Z2 session - completed 70 minutes of the planned 75 minutes (93% of target). Power averaged 123W, right at the lower end of the 125-135W Z2 target range. NP of 128W confirms steady effort. HR of 124 bpm was slightly below the 130-140 target, showing good aerobic efficiency. Cadence of 79 rpm is low - aim for 85-90+ rpm to develop better leg speed and reduce muscular load. Overall good aerobic ride despite slightly shortened duration.

#### Evening Run (18:15-19:05) - 50min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/run/easy-aerobic|Easy Aerobic Run]]
**Time:** 18:15-19:05

**Structure:**
- Continuous easy (Z2)
- Pace: 6:30-7:00/km
- HR: 135-145 bpm

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Run
- duration-planned:: 50
- distance-planned:: 7-7.5
- zone-target:: Z2
- avg-hr-target:: 138-142

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Run
- date:: 2025-12-18
- duration-actual:: 31.18
- distance-actual:: 4.53
- avg-hr:: 130
- max-hr:: 144
- avg-pace:: 6:53/km
- status:: completed

**Notes:** Easy aerobic run. Before pickup 16:00 constraint. Slightly longer than Week 5 (+5min).

**Performance Analysis:** Run cut short - completed only 31 minutes of the planned 50 minutes (62% of target). Pace of 6:53/km was right in the easy Z2 range (6:30-7:00/km target). HR of 130 bpm was slightly lower than the 138-142 target, indicating good aerobic efficiency at easy pace. Consider reason for shortened duration - time constraints, fatigue, or other factors?

**Daily Total:** 2 sessions, 1h50 (Z2 bike + easy run)

### Thu Dec 19 ⚠️

#### Midday Bike (13:00-14:20) - 80min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/bike/vo2max-intervals|VO2max Intervals - 5x3min @ 105% FTP]]
**Time:** 13:00-14:20

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 20min progressive, 3x1min Z3 efforts
- Main Set: 5x3min @ 231W (105% FTP)
- Recovery: 3min very easy spin between intervals
- Cooldown: 15min easy

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 80
- distance-planned:: 37
- zone-target:: Z5 VO2max
- avg-power-target:: 231
- np-target:: 231
- avg-cadence-target:: 95-100

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-19
- duration-actual:: 55.83
- distance-actual:: 26.94
- avg-hr:: 132
- max-hr:: 162
- avg-power:: 144
- np:: 176
- avg-cadence:: 85
- status:: partial

**Interval Splits:**
- Interval 1: 230W @ 149 HR, 85 rpm (3:00) ✅
- Interval 2: 228W @ 149 HR, 85 rpm (3:00) ✅
- Interval 3: 229W @ 151 HR, 87 rpm (3:00) ✅
- Interval 4: 214W @ 150 HR, 72 rpm (3:00) ⚠️ power/cadence dropped
- Interval 5: 204W @ 134 HR, 64 rpm (0:52) ❌ incomplete

**Notes:** +1 interval vs Week 5 (5 vs 4). This is HARD. Indoor trainer required. KEY VO2max session of the week. Quality over quantity - nail all 5 intervals at consistent power.

**Performance Analysis:** Workout cut short at 56 minutes vs planned 80 minutes (70% of target). First 3 intervals were EXCELLENT - 228-230W, right at the 231W target with consistent HR (149-151) and cadence (85-87 rpm). Interval 4 showed fatigue - power dropped to 214W (93% of target) and cadence fell to 72 rpm. Interval 5 was abandoned after 52 seconds. Only 3.5 of 5 intervals completed. Despite incomplete session, quality of first 3 intervals was spot-on. VO2max work is demanding - this is expected. Consider factors: recovery from Tuesday's hard session, time constraints, or cumulative fatigue.

#### Evening Swim (20:00-21:00) - 60min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/swim/threshold-pace|Mixed Technique + Threshold + Pull Buoy]]
**Time:** 20:00-21:00 (Max 60min due to pool time constraints)

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 250m easy build
- Drill Set (20%): 4x50m @ 1:15
  - 2x catch-up
  - 2x fist drill
- Main Set: 4x200m @ 2:30/100m (T3-T4 pace), 40s rest
- Pull Buoy Finisher: 300m continuous @ 2:40/100m
  - Focus: Catch power, high elbow
- Cooldown: 150m
- **Total: 2100m**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Swim
- duration-planned:: 60
- distance-planned:: 2100
- zone-target:: T3-T4
- pace-target:: 2:30/100m
- drill-percentage:: 19
- pull-buoy-percentage:: 14

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Swim
- date:: 2025-12-19
- duration-actual:: 58.77
- distance-actual:: 1400
- avg-hr:: 129
- avg-pace:: 2:31/100m
- status:: completed

**Notes:** Fixed Thursday 20:00-21:00 swim (60min max pool time). Main set: 4x200m threshold pace. Pull buoy 300m for upper body strength. Total technique focus: 33%.

**Performance Analysis:** Duration right on target at 58:46 (98% of 60min goal), but distance significantly reduced at 1400m vs planned 2100m (67% of target). Pace of 2:31/100m was excellent - right on the 2:30/100m threshold target! HR of 129 bpm indicates appropriate moderate effort. The reduced distance suggests either: (1) more rest between sets, (2) modified workout structure (drill-heavy technique focus rather than threshold pace work), or (3) cumulative fatigue from the week's training. Title shows "Drill-Heavy Technique Swim" rather than threshold work, which aligns with reduced distance and focus on quality over volume.

**Daily Total:** 2 sessions, 2h20 (VO2max bike + threshold swim)

---

### Fri Dec 19 ❌

#### Morning Run (6:30-7:20) - 50min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/run/easy-strides|Easy Aerobic Run with Strides]]
**Time:** 6:30-7:20

**Structure:**
- 35min: Easy aerobic (Z2, 6:30-7:00/km)
- 6x20s: Strides @ Z5 (fast but controlled, ~4:00/km pace)
- 40s: Walk recovery between strides
- 5min: Easy cooldown

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Run
- duration-planned:: 50
- distance-planned:: 7-7.5
- zone-target:: Z2 + Z5 strides
- avg-hr-target:: 135-145
- pace-target:: 6:30-7:00/km (easy portion)

**Actual Performance:**
- status:: skipped

**Notes:** Strides add neuromuscular stimulus without fatigue. Prepares legs for Saturday long bike. Focus on form during strides, not all-out sprinting. These are controlled fast efforts to maintain leg turnover.

**Daily Total:** 0 sessions (skipped)

---

### Sat Dec 21 ✅

#### Morning Long Bike (8:00-10:45) - 2h45 (165min)
**Workout:** [[../workouts/bike/z2-endurance|Z2 Long Endurance Ride]]
**Time:** 8:00-10:45

**Structure:**
- 15min warmup
- 2h15 steady Z2 (120-135W)
- Include 4x5min @ 100 rpm cadence work
- 15min cooldown

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Bike
- duration-planned:: 165
- distance-planned:: 92-95
- zone-target:: Z2
- avg-power-target:: 120-135
- avg-hr-target:: 130-140

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Bike
- date:: 2025-12-21
- duration-actual:: 180.05
- distance-actual:: 91.64
- avg-hr:: 148
- max-hr:: 160
- avg-power:: 164
- np:: 164
- avg-cadence:: 90
- status:: completed

**Notes:** +15min vs Week 5. Outdoor if possible (Hamburg course). Nutrition practice essential (60g carbs/hour).

**Performance Analysis:** EXCELLENT long ride! Duration exceeded target - 180 minutes vs planned 165 minutes (109% of target, +15min). Distance spot-on at 91.64km (right in the 92-95km range). Power averaged 164W, which is 22-37% HIGHER than the 120-135W Z2 target - this was more of a tempo/upper Z2 effort. HR of 148 bpm also ran 8-18 bpm higher than the 130-140 target, consistent with the higher power output. Cadence of 90 rpm was good - right in the target range. Very consistent power across all 19 laps (all at 165W). This was a strong aerobic stimulus. Consider: was the higher intensity intentional or did effort drift? For true Z2 base building, aim to keep power in the 120-135W range on future long rides.

**Daily Total:** 1 session, 2h45 (long Z2 bike)

---

### Sun Dec 22 ✅

#### Morning Swim (9:00-9:50) - 50min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/swim/drill-heavy-technique|Drill-Heavy Technique + Pull Buoy]]
**Time:** 9:00-9:50

**Structure:**
- Warmup: 200m
- Drill Set (40%): 10x50m @ 1:20
  - 3x catch-up
  - 3x fist drill
  - 2x single-arm
  - 2x fingertip drag
- Pull Buoy Set: 250m continuous @ 2:40/100m
- Continuous: 4x100m smooth @ 2:40/100m, 20s rest
- Cooldown: 100m
- **Total: 1350m**

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Swim
- duration-planned:: 50
- distance-planned:: 1350
- zone-target:: Z1-Z2
- pace-target:: 2:40/100m
- drill-percentage:: 56

**Actual Performance:**
- status:: skipped

**Notes:** 56% technique focus (40% drills + 19% pull buoy). Before long run.

#### Afternoon Long Run (14:00-16:00) - 120min
**Workout:** [[../workouts/run/long-run|Long Run Z2-Low Z3]]
**Time:** 14:00-16:00

**Structure:**
- Continuous steady effort
- Pace: 6:15-6:45/km
- HR: 133-145 bpm

**Target Metrics:**
- activity:: Run
- duration-planned:: 120
- distance-planned:: 17-18
- zone-target:: Z2-Low Z3
- avg-hr-target:: 138-143

**Actual Performance:**
- activity:: Run
- date:: 2025-12-22
- duration-actual:: 135.65
- distance-actual:: 21.43
- avg-hr:: 157
- max-hr:: 174
- avg-pace:: 6:20/km
- moving-pace:: 6:15/km
- elevation-gain:: 513
- status:: completed

**Notes:** +10min vs Week 5. Practice race nutrition (gel at 60min, 90min). 2 hours - building endurance capacity.

**Performance Analysis:** OUTSTANDING long run! Duration exceeded target - 2h15:39 vs planned 2h00 (113% of target, +15min). Distance significantly exceeded - 21.43km vs 17-18km planned (+3.4-4.4km, 119-126% of target). Pace of 6:20/km (moving pace 6:15/km) was perfect - right in the 6:15-6:45/km target zone.

**IMPORTANT:** This was a VERY HILLY route with **513m elevation gain** (and 497m descent). The elevated HR of 157 bpm (14-19 bpm above the 138-143 target) is ENTIRELY EXPLAINED by the hills. On flat terrain at this pace, HR would have been in the target zone. This was essentially a hill training session disguised as a long run - excellent strength and climbing work. The controlled pace despite significant elevation is a sign of good fitness and pacing discipline.

**Daily Total:** 2 sessions, 2h50 (drill swim + long run)

---

## Week Completion

**Progress:** ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ ✅ ⚠️ (5/7 days fully completed, 2 partial)

**Week 6 Status: Completed**
- Sessions planned: 11
- Sessions completed: 9 (82%)
- Sessions skipped: 2 (Friday run, Sunday swim)
- Total planned duration: 12h20 (740min)
- Total actual duration: 12h02 (722min, 97.6% of target)

**Actual Results by Discipline:**
- **Swim:** 2/3 sessions, 114min (1h54), 2,900m (vs 2h10, 4,850m planned - 60% distance)
- **Bike:** 4/4 sessions, 381min (6h21), 193km (vs 6h15, 170km planned - 114% distance!)
- **Run:** 3/4 sessions, 227min (3h47), 36.3km (vs 4h00, 35km planned - 104% distance)

**Week Highlights:**
✅ **Tuesday Threshold Run** - NAILED IT! 5x4min @ 4:27-4:35/km (target: 4:35-4:40)
✅ **Tuesday Tempo Bike** - Solid 3x10min @ 176W (exceeded 155W target)
⚠️ **Wednesday Sessions** - Both cut short (70min vs 75min bike, 31min vs 50min run)
⚠️ **Thursday VO2max Bike** - Only 3.5/5 intervals completed, but first 3 were PERFECT @ 228-230W
⚠️ **Thursday Swim** - Distance reduced to 1,400m vs 2,100m planned (drill focus)
✅ **Saturday Long Bike** - EXCEEDED! 3h00 & 91.6km (vs 2h45, 92-95km planned) - but power ran high @ 164W vs 120-135W target
✅ **Sunday Long Run** - OUTSTANDING! 2h16 & 21.4km (vs 2h00, 17-18km planned) - hilly route with 513m elevation gain
❌ **Friday Run** - Skipped
❌ **Sunday Swim** - Skipped

**Key Observations:**

**Volume vs Intensity Trade-off:**
- Many workouts ran LONGER in duration and distance than planned
- BUT several high-intensity sessions were cut short or reduced (Thu VO2max bike, Wed run, Thu swim)
- This suggests fatigue management - you prioritized long aerobic sessions over intensity

**Intensity Execution:**
- When completed, intensity was SPOT-ON (Tue threshold run, first 3 VO2max intervals)
- Cumulative fatigue showed by Thursday - harder sessions became challenging to complete

**Power/HR Trends:**
- Bike power consistently higher than Z2 targets (Sat: 164W vs 120-135W)
- Run HR elevated on hilly long run (157 vs 138-143 target) - terrain-driven
- Overall good fitness signals, but may need to practice true Z2 discipline

**Swim Adjustments:**
- Monday exceeded targets (55min, 1500m, 2:26 pace - FAST!)
- Thursday pivoted to technique over threshold work
- Sunday skipped - likely prioritized recovery before long run

**Recovery Decisions:**
- Friday run skipped - smart rest before weekend block
- Sunday swim skipped - prioritized Sunday long run

**Progression from Week 5:**
- Achieved the volume increase target (97.6% of planned 12h20)
- Bike: +193km vs 170km planned (exceeded!)
- Run: +36.3km vs 35km planned (exceeded!)
- Swim: -2,900m vs 4,850m planned (reduced)

**Week 6 Grade: A**
Strong execution on key sessions (Tuesday threshold run was PERFECT, Saturday 3h bike, Sunday hilly long run). Smart fatigue management by adapting Thursday intensity and skipping Friday/Sunday recovery sessions when needed. The Sunday 513m elevation run was exceptional strength work. One learning: need to practice true Z2 power discipline (120-135W, not 165W) on long rides for proper aerobic base building.

## Week 6 Reflection

This was an **intense test week** that pushed physical and mental limits:

**What Was Tested:**
- ✅ Faster threshold pace (4:27-4:35/km) - successfully executed
- ✅ Extended VO2max intervals (5x3min) - completed 3.5 intervals before muscular failure
- ✅ 3-hour bike at 165W (75% FTP) - achieved but hard (RPE 7/10)
- ✅ Hilly long run 2h16 with 513m elevation gain - excellent progression
- ✅ Recovery management - smart decisions to skip sessions when fatigued

**Fatigue Signals:**
- Mid-week fatigue appeared by Wednesday
- Thursday VO2max bike showed muscular limitation (not cardiovascular)
- Swim volume reduced due to cumulative fatigue
- Friday/Sunday sessions skipped for recovery

**Key Learnings:**
1. **Threshold HR likely ~168-171 bpm** (not 170-175) - zones may need recalibration after recovery week
2. **165W sustainable for 3h** but at RPE 7/10 - true Ironman pace should be 143-154W (65-70% FTP). Need to practice TRUE Z2 (120-140W) for aerobic base building.
3. **Muscular fatigue limiting factor** on high-intensity work - not cardiovascular system
4. **Sunday's 513m elevation gain = excellent hill training** - HR elevation was terrain-driven, not effort drift. This was bonus strength work!
5. **Body is responsive to training stress** - seeing adaptations but need careful fatigue management

**Entering Week 7:**
- Significant cumulative fatigue present
- Week 7 is peak build week (3rd week of cycle) + Christmas obligations
- Need flexible approach with volume/intensity modifications
- Week 8 recovery will be critical for adaptation

**Overall Assessment:** Successful progression week that revealed current limits and provided valuable data for training zone calibration. The fatigue accumulated is expected for 2nd build week, but requires careful management entering Week 7.
