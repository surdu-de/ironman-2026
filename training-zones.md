# Training Zones

## Bike Zones (Based on FTP)

| Zone | Name | % FTP | Watts @ 225W FTP | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|------------------|---------|
| **Z1** | Active Recovery | < 50% | < 113W | Recovery rides, warm-up/cool-down |
| **Z2** | Endurance | 50-65% | 113-146W | Aerobic base, long rides, fat burning |
| **Z3** | Tempo | 65-75% | 146-169W | Sustained efforts, race pace practice |
| **Z4** | Threshold | 75-85% | 169-191W | Lactate threshold, time trial efforts |
| **Z5** | VO2 Max | 85-95% | 191-214W | High-intensity intervals, max aerobic |

**Current FTP:** **225W** ⬆️ (2.50 W/kg at 90kg body weight)
- **Previous:** 220W baseline (2.44 W/kg)
- **20-Min FTP Test (Jan 6, 2026):** 225W
- **Improvement:** +5W (+2.3%)
- **Test Notes:** Week 9 testing - fresh legs after 3-day rest (Sat-Sun-Mon)

## Run Zones (Based on Heart Rate)

**Zone Calculation Method:** BOM (Beginning of Mellow)

**Updated Heart Rate Data (Week 4 Test - Dec 7, 2025):**
- **Max HR:** 191 bpm (historical)
- **LTHR (Lactate Threshold):** **180 bpm** ⬆️ (updated from 171 bpm)
- **Test Max HR:** 184 bpm (observed during 30min threshold test)
- **Resting HR:** 72 bpm

| Zone | Name | HR Range (bpm) | Purpose |
|------|------|----------------|---------|
| **Z1** | Recovery | 95-113 | Easy recovery runs, warm-up |
| **Z2** | Easy/Aerobic | 114-132 | Very easy aerobic, recovery weeks |
| **Z3** | Tempo | 133-151 | Sustained tempo runs, race pace |
| **Z4** | Threshold | 152-179 | Lactate threshold, hard efforts |
| **Z5** | VO2 Max | 180+ | Intervals, speed work, max effort |

**Current VO2 Max:** 50

**Lactate Threshold Pace:** **4:35/km** ⬆️ (at 180 bpm LTHR, updated from 4:48/km)
- **Previous:** 4:48/km at 171 bpm
- **Improvement:** **+13 seconds/km faster**
- **Threshold Power:** 455W (NP 454W)

### Training Zone Application

**For "Easy" or "Aerobic" runs in training plan:**
- **Target:** Low Z3 (133-145 bpm)
- **Rationale:** Pragmatic approach for 30-week sustainability
- **Pace Range:** ~6:15-6:45/km (conversational)

**For designated "Recovery" runs:**
- **Target:** Z2 (114-132 bpm)
- **When:** Recovery weeks, post-hard workout days

**For "Tempo" or "Threshold" workouts:**
- **Target:** Upper Z3 to Z4 (145-170 bpm)
- **When:** Designated workout days only

## Swim Zones (Based on CSS)

| Zone | Name | Pace Range | % CSS | Purpose |
|------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| **T1** | Recovery/Easy | > 2:42/100m | > 110% | Warm-up, cool-down, recovery |
| **T2** | Aerobic/Endurance | 2:27-2:42/100m | 100-110% | Long steady swims, technique work |
| **T3** | Tempo | 2:12-2:27/100m | 90-100% | Sustained efforts, race pace |
| **T4** | Threshold | 1:58-2:12/100m | 80-90% | Hard efforts, lactate threshold |
| **T5** | VO2 Max/Sprint | < 1:58/100m | < 80% | Short intervals, max effort |

**Current CSS:** **2:27/100m** ⬆️ (147 seconds per 100m, updated from 2:33/100m)
- **Previous:** 2:33/100m (153 seconds)
- **Improvement:** **+6 seconds faster per 100m**
- **Test Date:** December 4, 2025 (Week 4)

- **Week 4:** Dec 4-6, 2025
- **Week 12:** Jan 26 - Feb 1, 2026
- **Week 20:** Mar 23-29, 2026
- **Week 28:** May 18-24, 2026

See [Performance Data](performance-data.md) for testing results and zone calculations.
