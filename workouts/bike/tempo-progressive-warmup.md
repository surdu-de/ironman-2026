# Tempo Intervals - Progressive Warmup

## Description
Tempo interval workout with a systematic progressive warmup structure. This Garmin Gran Fondo plan workout builds through Z2→Z3→Z4 before the main tempo intervals, ensuring full physiological readiness. The progressive activation prepares aerobic and anaerobic systems for sustained tempo work.

## Workout Structure (60 minutes total)

### Phase 1: Progressive Warmup (17 minutes)
1. **5min @ Z2** (107-144W)
   - Easy aerobic pace
   - HR: 125-145 bpm
   - Establish smooth pedaling

2. **5min @ Z3** (144-175W)
   - Build to tempo intensity
   - HR: 145-165 bpm
   - Feel the effort increase

3. **5min @ Z4** (175-204W)
   - Threshold effort
   - HR: 155-165 bpm
   - This opens up aerobic system

4. **2min @ Z1** (0-107W)
   - Easy recovery spin
   - Let HR settle before main work

### Phase 2: Main Set (26 minutes)
**Repeat 2 times:**
- **Press lap button** (marks start of interval)
- **10min @ Z3 Tempo** (144-175W / 75-90% FTP)
  - Target: 150-170W sustained
  - HR: 145-165 bpm (will stabilize after 2-3min)
  - Cadence: 90-95 rpm
  - RPE: 6-7/10 (moderate-hard, "comfortably uncomfortable")
  - Breathing: Elevated but controlled

- **3min @ Z2 Recovery** (107-144W)
  - Active recovery, keep legs moving
  - HR will drop 10-15 bpm
  - Prepare mentally for next interval

**Total tempo work:** 2 x 10min = 20 minutes @ Z3

### Phase 3: Cooldown (17 minutes)
- **10min @ Z2** (107-144W)
  - Steady aerobic pace
  - Normalize HR and breathing

- **7min @ Z1** (0-107W)
  - Easy spin to finish
  - Complete recovery

## Execution Guidelines

### Progressive Warmup
- **Z2 (5min):** Conversational pace, smooth pedaling
- **Z3 (5min):** Increase to tempo feel, notice breathing elevate
- **Z4 (5min):** KEY SEGMENT - threshold effort primes aerobic system
- **Z1 (2min):** Brief recovery allows HR to drop before main work
- Purpose: Systematically activate energy systems for sustained tempo

### Main Tempo Intervals
- **Power target:** 144-175W (adjust to your FTP: 75-90%)
- **Cadence:** 90-95 rpm (steady turnover)
- **Effort:** RPE 6-7/10 - "I can hold this but it's not easy"
- **Breathing:** Elevated, rhythmic - can speak short sentences
- **Focus:** Smooth, steady power delivery throughout

### Recovery Between Intervals
- **3 minutes @ Z2** - not Z1! This is active recovery
- Keep legs moving at aerobic pace
- HR should drop but stay in training zone
- Mental reset for next 10min effort

## Success Criteria
- Complete 17min progressive warmup as structured
- Execute both 10min tempo intervals at target power
- Maintain power within 5-10W throughout each interval
- Keep cadence 90-95 rpm during tempo efforts
- Second interval feels harder but power stays consistent
- Complete full cooldown structure

## Key Differences from Standard Tempo
This workout differs from the standard `tempo-intervals.md`:
- **Progressive warmup:** Structured Z2→Z3→Z4→Z1 (vs simple 15min build)
- **Longer intervals:** 10min @ Z3 (vs shorter 8min or mixed formats)
- **Shorter recovery:** 3min @ Z2 (vs 5min, but intervals are also longer)
- **Only 2 intervals:** Focus on quality over quantity
- **Z4 activation:** 5min threshold effort in warmup is key differentiator
- **Extended cooldown:** 17min structured cooldown

## Indoor vs Outdoor Execution

### Indoor (Recommended for precision)
- **Equipment:** Smart trainer with power meter
- **Mode:** ERG mode for consistent watts, or resistance mode for feel
- **Benefits:** Precise power control, uninterrupted intervals
- **Setup:** Good cooling, water, entertainment optional
- **Focus:** Nail power targets, maintain smooth pedaling

### Outdoor (Advanced execution)
- **Course:** Flat to rolling, minimal stops
- **Surface:** Good roads or bike paths
- **Benefits:** Mental engagement, real-world practice
- **Challenges:** Must maintain effort through terrain changes
- **Tip:** Find 10min+ uninterrupted segments for intervals

## Pacing Strategy
- **Interval #1:** Start at lower end of zone (150W), build if feeling good
- **Recovery #1:** Stay in Z2, resist urge to go too easy
- **Interval #2:** Hit target from start, expect it to feel harder
- **Recovery #2:** Not applicable (cooldown begins)

**Key insight:** These are LONG intervals (10min). Start controlled.

## Recovery Needs
- **Day before:** Easy or rest recommended
- **Day after:** Easy Z2 or light intensity okay
- **Weekly frequency:** 1x per week during build weeks
- **Recovery weeks:** Skip or reduce to 1x8min @ Z3

## Common Mistakes
- **Skipping Z4 warmup:** This 5min segment is crucial - don't cut it
- **Too hard on tempo:** Pushing into Z4 threshold (save that effort)
- **Too easy on tempo:** Staying in upper Z2 instead of true tempo
- **Z1 recovery between:** Should be Z2 (active recovery, not rest)
- **Inconsistent power:** Big swings within the 10min intervals
- **Mental defeat:** 10min feels long - break into 2x5min mentally

## Physiological Purpose
- **Progressive warmup:** Activates aerobic system through multiple zones
- **Z4 activation segment:** Primes lactate clearance pathways
- **10min tempo intervals:** Builds sustained aerobic capacity
- **Shorter recovery:** Teaches body to recover while still working
- **Extended cooldown:** Promotes adaptation and recovery

## Notes
- This is a Garmin Gran Fondo plan workout - follow structure exactly
- The Z2→Z3→Z4 warmup progression is scientifically designed
- 5min @ Z4 in warmup is the key - fully activates aerobic engine
- 10min tempo intervals are longer than typical - requires mental focus
- Only 2 intervals keeps quality high (vs 3-4 shorter intervals)
- 3min Z2 recovery (not Z1) teaches active recovery skill
- Can be done indoor or outdoor depending on conditions
- Total tempo time: 20 minutes @ Z3 (significant aerobic stimulus)
- This is a "sweet spot" workout - hard enough to drive adaptation, sustainable enough to complete with quality
- Great for building race-day sustainable power

## Workout Origin
**Garmin Gran Fondo Training Plan**
- Workout name: "Aerobic with Tempo Intervals"
- Purpose: Build aerobic capacity and sustained tempo power
- Description: "60 Minute Workout - Warm up. - Ride 10 minutes at tempo, 3 minutes recovery pace in zone 2. Repeat 2 times. - Finish the hour with a 10 minute Z2 cooldown pace ride"
- Note: "If you're not used to these sustained efforts, you'll build the capacity to hold this intensity. As you get better, you'll be able to reduce recovery time between the reps, and work toward longer and longer intervals at this intensity."
