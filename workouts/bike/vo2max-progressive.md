# VO2max Intervals - Progressive Warmup

## Description
High-intensity VO2max workout with a detailed progressive warmup structure. This Garmin Gran Fondo plan workout systematically prepares the body through multiple intensity zones before the main Z5 intervals. The progressive warmup includes Z5 "openers" to prime the neuromuscular system.

**Source:** Garmin Gran Fondo Training Plan - "Zone 5 Intervals (3 Times)"

## Workout Structure (60 minutes total)

### Phase 1: Progressive Warmup (24 minutes)
1. **5min @ Z1** (0-107W)
   - Easy spin, establish rhythm
   - HR: <125 bpm

2. **5min @ Z2** (107-144W)
   - Increase to conversational pace
   - HR: 125-145 bpm

3. **5min @ Z4** (175-204W)
   - Build to threshold intensity
   - HR: 155-165 bpm
   - This is KEY - opens up the legs

4. **2min @ Z1** (0-107W)
   - Recovery spin

5. **3 x (30sec @ Z5 + 2min @ Z1)** = 7.5min
   - **30sec @ Z5** (204-234W) - Sharp efforts
   - **2min @ Z1** - Full recovery between
   - Purpose: Prime neuromuscular system for main set

### Phase 2: Main Set (3 intervals, ~21 minutes)
**Repeat 3 times:**
- **Press lap button** (marks start of interval)
- **2min @ Z5** (204-234W / >108% FTP)
  - Target: 210-230W sustained
  - HR: 165+ bpm (will lag, use power)
  - Cadence: 95-100 rpm
  - RPE: 9/10 (very hard)
- **4min @ Z1** (0-107W)
  - Very easy recovery spin
  - Let HR drop below 130 bpm
  - Mentally prepare for next interval

**Total main work:** 3 x 2min = 6 minutes @ Z5

### Phase 3: Extended Cooldown (15 minutes)
- **15min @ Z2** (107-144W)
  - Steady aerobic pace
  - Flush legs, normalize HR

- **5min @ Z1** (0-107W)
  - Final easy spin
  - Complete recovery

## Execution Guidelines

### Progressive Warmup
- **First 10min (Z1-Z2):** Let body wake up gradually
- **5min Z4:** This is CRITICAL - gets HR elevated and legs ready
- **Z5 openers (3x30sec):** Sharp efforts, not all-out, just wake up fast-twitch fibers
- Don't skip any part of the warmup structure

### Main Z5 Intervals
- **Power target:** 204-234W (adjust to your FTP: >108%)
- **Cadence:** 95-100 rpm (higher turnover than threshold)
- **Effort:** Very hard but sustainable for 2 minutes
- **Breathing:** Heavy and rapid
- **Focus:** Smooth power delivery, stay seated

### Recovery Intervals
- **Spin very easy** - Z1 only, don't cheat
- **Full 4 minutes** - use every second
- **HR recovery** - should drop below 130 bpm
- **Stay loose** - keep legs moving, don't coast

## Success Criteria
- Complete all 24min progressive warmup as structured
- Execute all 3 x 2min Z5 intervals at target power
- Minimal power fade across the 3 intervals (±10W acceptable)
- Maintain 95-100 rpm cadence throughout Z5 efforts
- Feel exhausted but accomplished

## Key Differences from Standard VO2max
This workout differs from the standard `vo2max-intervals.md`:
- **Progressive warmup:** Structured through Z1→Z2→Z4→Z5 openers (vs simple 15min build)
- **Shorter intervals:** 2min @ Z5 (vs 3min)
- **Longer recovery:** 4min Z1 between (vs 5min but after longer intervals)
- **Z5 openers:** 3x30sec efforts prime the system before main set
- **Extended cooldown:** 20min total (15min Z2 + 5min Z1)

## Indoor Setup Requirements
**This workout REQUIRES indoor trainer:**
- Smart trainer with power meter (ERG mode recommended)
- Excellent cooling (2+ fans)
- Water bottles easily accessible
- Heart rate monitor
- Towel (you will need it!)

**Why indoor only:**
- Complex structure impossible to execute on road
- Power targets must be precise
- No interruptions (traffic, lights, terrain)
- Safety - these efforts are exhausting

## Pacing Strategy
- **Interval #1:** Hit target power, feel it out (should feel 8.5/10)
- **Interval #2:** Maintain same power, will feel harder (9/10)
- **Interval #3:** Give everything remaining, controlled (9.5/10)

**Critical:** Don't blow up on interval #1. These get MUCH harder.

## Recovery Needs
- **Day before:** Easy Z2 or complete rest
- **Day after:** Easy Z2 recovery ride ONLY (no intensity)
- **Next hard session:** Not before 48 hours minimum
- **Weekly frequency:** Maximum 1x per week during build weeks
- **Recovery weeks:** SKIP entirely

## Common Mistakes
- **Skipping warmup steps:** Every phase matters, especially the Z4 buildup
- **Too hard on Z5 openers:** These are primers, not main work (80% effort)
- **Going all-out interval #1:** You have 3 to complete, pace yourself
- **Inadequate recovery:** Full 4 minutes needed between intervals
- **Outdoor attempt:** Don't even try - too complex for road execution

## Notes
- This is a Garmin Gran Fondo plan workout - follow structure exactly
- The progressive warmup is scientifically designed - trust the process
- 2min intervals are deceptively hard - shorter than 3min but higher intensity
- Z4 warmup segment is the "secret sauce" - primes aerobic system
- Z5 openers (3x30sec) wake up fast-twitch fibers
- Indoor trainer required - this cannot be done outdoors safely
- Total Z5 work time: 7.5min (1.5min openers + 6min main intervals)
- Despite "only" 2min intervals, this is an extremely hard workout
- Mental toughness builder - embrace the structured suffering
- Skip if feeling fatigued - quality over everything

## Workout Origin
**Garmin Gran Fondo Training Plan**
- Workout name: "Zone 5 Intervals (3 Times)"
- Purpose: Boost VO2max and "speed endurance"
- Description: "Goal is to hold a steady near-max effort for each of all three 2 minute intervals, but you should find it hard to finish each interval"
