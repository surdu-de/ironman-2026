# Anaerobic Sweetspot

## Description
High-intensity sustained intervals above FTP threshold designed to build power at anaerobic capacity. These are HARD, sustained efforts at 106-113% FTP that challenge your ability to maintain power output above threshold. Different from VO2max work - these focus on extending time-to-exhaustion at supra-threshold power.

## Common Formats

### Format 1: 3x8min @ 106% FTP
- **Total Duration:** 75min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive, include 2x2min @ Z3 build efforts
- **Main Set:** 3x8min @ 234W (106% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 5min very easy spin (Z1, 80-100W) between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

### Format 2: 3x10min @ 107% FTP
- **Total Duration:** 85min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive
- **Main Set:** 3x10min @ 235W (107% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 5min very easy spin between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

### Format 3: 4x8min @ 108% FTP
- **Total Duration:** 85min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive with Z3 primers
- **Main Set:** 4x8min @ 237W (108% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 5min very easy spin between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

### Format 4: 4x10min @ 107% FTP (Advanced)
- **Total Duration:** 95min
- **Warmup:** 25min progressive
- **Main Set:** 4x10min @ 235W (107% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 5min very easy spin between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

## Execution Guidelines
- **Heart Rate:** Upper Z4/Low Z5 (155-170 bpm / 85-95% HRmax)
- **Power:** 233-248W (106-113% FTP based on 220W FTP)
- **Cadence:** 90-95 rpm (controlled, not sprinting)
- **Effort:** RPE 8-9/10 - "very hard but sustainable"
- **Breathing:** Deep, controlled, rhythmic
- **Feel:** On the edge of threshold but holding steady

**CRITICAL Points:**
- NOT all-out efforts - controlled hard power
- Power should be rock-steady throughout each interval
- If power drops >5W, interval quality is compromised
- These are different from VO2max - lower peak intensity, longer duration
- Builds your ability to hold high power for extended periods

## Success Criteria
- Complete all prescribed intervals at target power ±3W
- Power variability <5W within each interval
- Maintain target cadence (90-95 rpm)
- Recovery HR drops to <130 bpm between intervals
- Feel exhausted but successful (not destroyed)

## Pacing Strategy
- **First interval:** Start at exact target power, don't go over
- **Middle intervals:** Lock into target power from first pedal stroke
- **Final interval:** Hold target power, resist urge to "sprint finish"

**Critical mistake to avoid:** Starting 5-10W too hard and fading badly

## Indoor Execution (REQUIRED)
- **Equipment:** Smart trainer with accurate power meter
- **Mode:** ERG mode strongly recommended for power consistency
- **Setup:** Excellent cooling (2+ fans), towels, easy gear access
- **Environment:** Minimal distractions - these require total focus
- **Motivation:** Queue up music/video - these are mentally tough

## Warmup Importance
**CRITICAL:** Thorough warmup required for anaerobic work
- 20-25min progressive aerobic riding (Z1→Z2)
- Include 2-3 build efforts to Z3 (2min each)
- Feel "opened up" and ready before starting
- Heart rate should be elevated (>130 bpm) pre-first interval

## Recovery Between Intervals
- **Very easy spin:** Z1 only (80-100W), no temptation to push
- **Full 5min duration:** Don't cut short even if feeling good
- **Heart rate recovery:** Should drop below 130 bpm
- **Cadence:** Keep legs turning at 80-85 rpm
- **Mental reset:** Use time to prepare for next interval

## Progression Through Training Cycles

**Cycle 2 (Weeks 5-7):**
- Week 5: 3x8min @ 234W (106% FTP)
- Week 6: Rest or tempo alternative
- Week 7: 4x8min @ 237W (108% FTP)

**Cycle 3 (Weeks 9-10):**
- Week 9: 3x10min @ 235W (107% FTP)
- Week 10: Rest or tempo alternative

**General Progression:**
1. Add duration: 8min → 10min
2. Add reps: 3 intervals → 4 intervals
3. Add power: +1-3W every 2-3 weeks

## Recovery Needs
- **Day before:** Easy Z2 ride or rest
- **Day after:** Easy spin or complete rest recommended
- **Weekly frequency:** Maximum 1x per week
- **Rest week:** SKIP entirely
- **Between sessions:** 7-10 days minimum

## Physiological Effects
- Builds power at anaerobic threshold
- Improves lactate buffering capacity
- Extends time-to-exhaustion above FTP
- Significant neuromuscular fatigue
- Supports FTP gains over 8-12 weeks
- High training stimulus, requires 7+ days full recovery

## Difference from VO2max Work
**Anaerobic Sweetspot (this workout):**
- 106-113% FTP sustained
- 8-10min intervals
- Focus: Extend time above threshold
- RPE 8-9/10

**VO2max Intervals:**
- 105-120% FTP with variability
- 2-4min intervals
- Focus: Peak aerobic capacity
- RPE 9-10/10

## Common Mistakes
- **Starting too hard:** Going 110-115% FTP and blowing up
- **Power variability:** Surging and fading (should be steady)
- **Insufficient warmup:** Starting intervals cold
- **Rushed recovery:** Not taking full 5min between intervals
- **Too frequent:** Doing these more than 1x per week
- **Wrong intensity:** Confusing with VO2max (different stimulus)

## Integration with Weekly Training
**Typical Week Structure:**
- **Monday:** Rest
- **Tuesday:** THIS WORKOUT (anaerobic sweetspot)
- **Wednesday:** Easy Z2 recovery
- **Thursday:** VO2max intervals (different stimulus)
- **Friday:** Easy recovery
- **Weekend:** Long Z2 ride

**Key Principle:** Separate from VO2max work by 48h minimum

## Mental Approach
- **Acceptance:** These hurt - that's the point
- **Focus:** Lock into target power, don't look at time remaining
- **Segments:** Break each interval into 2min chunks
- **Mantras:** "Steady power, smooth cadence, controlled breathing"
- **Celebration:** Each completed interval is a victory

## Notes
- Indoor trainer execution is NON-NEGOTIABLE for power accuracy
- These are harder mentally than physically - embrace discomfort
- Quality matters infinitely more than quantity
- If power drops >10W, END the interval and take extra recovery
- Better to nail 3 perfect intervals than struggle through 4 poor ones
- This workout delivers massive FTP gains over 8-12 weeks
- Actual format specified in weekly schedule
- Skip if feeling fatigued - no heroics!
- Track power consistency as key metric of quality
