# Easy Recovery Ride

## Description
Ultra-light spinning session focused purely on active recovery. The primary goal is promoting blood flow to aid recovery without adding any training stress. If in doubt, go easier.

## Execution
- **Duration Range:** 30-60 minutes (prescribed in weekly schedule)
- **Distance Range:** ~12-25km
- **Heart Rate:** Z1-Z2 (115-140 bpm, mostly Z1)
- **Power:** 75-120W (<60% FTP, targeting 50-55%)
- **Cadence:** 85-95 rpm (light and easy)
- **Effort:** Extremely easy, almost ridiculously so

**Structure:**
- 5-10min: Very easy warmup
- Main: Steady easy spinning, no surges
- 5min: Easy spin out

## Success Criteria
- Heart rate NEVER exceeds 140 bpm
- Power stays well below 60% FTP
- Feel refreshed and loose afterward
- Zero fatigue added
- Legs feel better than before ride

## The Recovery Mindset
**Purpose:** This is NOT a workout - it's active recovery
- Don't chase any numbers
- Ego check at the door
- Slower/easier is better
- If you're breathing hard, SLOW DOWN
- Should feel almost comically easy

## When to Use
### Day After Hard Session
- Following VO2max intervals
- After long endurance ride
- Day after threshold run
- Post-race recovery

### Recovery Weeks
- Replace regular Z2 sessions
- Maintain routine without stress
- Active rest while staying loose

### Between Key Workouts
- Fill gap between hard sessions
- Promote recovery without fatigue
- Maintain bike familiarity

## Indoor vs Outdoor

### Indoor (Preferred)
- **Benefits:** Precise power control, no temptation to push
- **Setup:** Easy gear, comfortable position, entertainment
- **Mode:** Resistance mode or very light erg mode
- **Focus:** Zone out, relax, don't think

### Outdoor
- **Course:** Completely flat, zero hills
- **Conditions:** Good weather only (no fighting wind)
- **Warning:** Very easy to accidentally push too hard outdoors
- **Rule:** If you feel ANY resistance, gear down or slow down

## Common Mistakes (AVOID THESE!)
- **Going too hard:** "I feel good so I'll push a bit" → NO!
- **Chasing watts:** Trying to hit Z2 instead of Z1
- **Adding intensity:** "Just a few surges" → defeats purpose
- **Hills:** Attempting climbs (raises HR/power too much)
- **Group rides:** Trying to keep up with others
- **Competition:** Racing traffic lights, other cyclists

## Signs You're Doing It Right
- Feel slightly bored from the easy pace
- Could easily maintain conversation
- Breathing barely elevated
- Legs feel loose and fresh
- Heart rate stays rock solid in Z1-Z2
- Thinking "am I even doing anything?"

## Signs You're Going Too Hard
- Breathing becomes noticeable
- Can't hold steady conversation
- Heart rate creeping above 140 bpm
- Any sense of "working"
- Starting to feel warm/sweaty beyond room temp

## Equipment & Setup
- **Trainer:** Any trainer works (basic is fine)
- **Cooling:** Less critical than hard sessions
- **Entertainment:** Perfect for TV, podcast, audiobook
- **Hydration:** Water only, no fuel needed

## Duration Guidelines
- **30-40min:** Minimum effective recovery ride
- **45min:** Standard recovery session
- **60min:** Extended recovery (rare, usually 45min max)

## Notes
- This ride should feel almost embarrassingly easy
- If your ego is bruised by how slow you're going, you're doing it right
- Power is more reliable than HR for recovery rides
- Can be done the day before a hard session too
- When tired, skip entirely rather than pushing
- Actual duration specified in weekly schedule
- Perfect opportunity for mental rest too
