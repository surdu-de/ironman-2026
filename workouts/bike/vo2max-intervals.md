# VO2max Intervals

## Description
High-intensity interval workout targeting VO2max development. These are VERY HARD efforts that push close to maximum sustainable power. Critical for improving peak performance but require significant recovery. Quality over quantity is paramount.

## Common Formats

### Format 1: 3x3min @ 105% FTP (Medium Intervals)
- **Total Duration:** 60min
- **Warmup:** 15min progressive, include 2x1min @ Z3 efforts
- **Main Set:** 3x3min @ 231W (105% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 3min very easy spin (Z1, 80-100W) between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

### Format 2: 4x3min @ 105% FTP (Medium Intervals)
- **Total Duration:** 70min
- **Warmup:** 20min with 3x1min build efforts
- **Main Set:** 4x3min @ 231W (105% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 3min Z1 between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

### Format 3: 5x3min @ 105% FTP (Medium Intervals - Advanced)
- **Total Duration:** 75min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive
- **Main Set:** 5x3min @ 231W (105% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 3min Z1 between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

### Format 4: 3x4min @ 105% FTP (Longer Medium Intervals)
- **Total Duration:** 75min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive, 3x1min Z3 primers
- **Main Set:** 3x4min @ 231W (105% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 4min very easy spin between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 20min easy

### Format 5: 4x4min @ 105% FTP (Peak Medium Intervals)
- **Total Duration:** 85min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive, 3x1min Z3 primers
- **Main Set:** 4x4min @ 231W (105% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 4min very easy spin between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 20min easy

### Format 6: 3x4min @ 107% FTP (High Intensity Medium)
- **Total Duration:** 75min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive
- **Main Set:** 3x4min @ 235W (107% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 4min very easy spin between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 20min easy

### Format 7: 4x4min @ 107% FTP (Peak High Intensity)
- **Total Duration:** 85min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive
- **Main Set:** 4x4min @ 235W (107% FTP)
- **Recovery:** 4min very easy spin between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 20min easy

### Format 8: 5x2min @ Z5 (Short Intervals - Legacy)
- **Total Duration:** 65min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive
- **Main Set:** 5x2min @ VO2max
- **Recovery:** 4min Z1 between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

## Execution Guidelines
- **Heart Rate:** Z5 (165+ bpm / >95% HRmax)
- **Power:** 210+W (>108% FTP, targeting 115-120%)
- **Cadence:** 95-100 rpm (higher turnover)
- **Effort:** RPE 9/10 - "very hard, near maximum"
- **Breathing:** Heavy, rapid
- **Feel:** Can only sustain for the prescribed duration

**CRITICAL Points:**
- These are NOT all-out sprints - sustainable hard efforts
- First interval should feel like 8.5/10, last like 9.5/10
- If you can talk, you're not going hard enough
- Recovery between intervals is absolutely critical
- Better to nail 3 quality intervals than struggle through 5 poor ones

## Success Criteria
- Complete prescribed intervals at target power/HR
- Maintain power output across all intervals (minimal fade)
- Hit target cadence (95-100 rpm)
- Recovery heart rate drops below 130 bpm between intervals
- Feel exhausted but accomplished

## Pacing Strategy
- **First interval:** Start controlled, build to target power
- **Middle intervals:** Hit target power from start, maintain
- **Final interval:** All remaining energy, but controlled

**Critical mistake to avoid:** Going all-out on first interval and fading badly

## Indoor vs Outdoor

### Indoor (STRONGLY Preferred)
- **Equipment:** Smart trainer with power meter
- **Mode:** Erg mode for consistent power
- **Benefits:** Precise power targets, no interruptions, safe
- **Setup:** Excellent cooling (multiple fans), easy gear access

### Outdoor (Advanced only)
- **Course:** Steady climbing or false flat (no stops!)
- **Focus:** Sustained power, no coasting
- **Challenges:** Very difficult to execute properly
- **Safety:** Requires total focus - dangerous when exhausted

## Warmup Importance
**CRITICAL:** These intervals require thorough warmup
- 15-20min progressive aerobic riding
- Include 2-3 short (1min) build efforts to Z3
- Feel ready and "opened up" before starting
- Don't skimp on warmup to save time!

## Recovery Between Intervals
- **Spin very easy:** Z1 only, no shortcuts
- **Full duration:** Don't rush even if feeling good
- **Heart rate recovery:** Should drop below 130 bpm
- **Mental reset:** Use time to prepare for next rep

## Progression Through Training
- **Early phase:** 3x3min (build tolerance)
- **Mid phase:** 4x3min (increase volume)
- **Peak phase:** 5x2min or 4x4min (advanced formats)

## Recovery Needs
- **Day before:** Easy ride or complete rest
- **Day after:** Easy spin or complete rest (VERY important)
- **Weekly frequency:** Maximum 1x per week, often every 10-14 days
- **Rest week:** SKIP entirely
- **Between sessions:** 7-10 days minimum

## Common Mistakes
- **Starting too hard:** Blowing up on first interval
- **Insufficient warmup:** Starting intervals cold
- **Rushed recovery:** Not taking full rest between intervals
- **Too frequent:** Doing these more than 1x per week
- **Adding volume:** Trying to do 6-8 intervals (3-5 is plenty!)
- **Outdoor chaos:** Attempting on roads with stops/traffic

## Physiological Effects
- Highest stimulus for VO2max improvement
- Significant fatigue - impacts next 48-72 hours
- High neuromuscular stress
- Requires 7-10 days for full adaptation
- Not sustainable long-term (use strategically)

## Notes
- This is the HARDEST bike workout in your plan
- Less is more - quality trumps quantity always
- Indoor execution strongly preferred
- Mental toughness builder - embrace the suffering
- These hurt but deliver massive fitness gains
- Actual format specified in weekly schedule
- Skip if feeling fatigued or unwell - no heroics!
