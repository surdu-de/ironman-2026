# Z2 Endurance Ride

## Description
Foundational aerobic ride at Zone 2 intensity. Used for base building, fat adaptation, and steady-state endurance development. Duration varies from short indoor sessions (45-60min) to long outdoor rides (2-2.5h).

## Execution
- **Duration Range:** 45min - 2h30 (prescribed in weekly schedule)
- **Distance Range:** ~20-75km (depending on duration and outdoor/indoor)
- **Heart Rate:** Z2 (125-145 bpm)
- **Power:** 110-146W (56-75% FTP)
- **Cadence:** 85-95 rpm
- **Effort:** Comfortable, conversational pace

**Structure:**
- 10-15min: Easy warmup spin, gradually increase to Z2
- Main Set: Steady Z2 effort throughout
- 5-10min: Easy cooldown spin (longer rides get longer cooldown)

## Duration Guidelines
- **45-60min:** Indoor trainer, midweek sessions
- **75-90min:** Extended indoor or outdoor
- **2-2.5h:** Long outdoor endurance rides (weekend)

## Success Criteria
- Heart rate stays in Z2 zone (125-145 bpm)
- Power output steady within range (if using power meter)
- Cadence consistent at 85-95 rpm
- Feel fresh and ready for next workout
- For long rides: successful nutrition execution

## Indoor vs Outdoor

### Indoor (45-90min)
- **Equipment:** Trainer (wheel-on or direct drive)
- **Setup:** Fan for cooling, water, HR/power
- **Benefits:** Controlled environment, consistent power
- **Focus:** Smooth pedaling, cadence work, form

### Outdoor (60min-2h30)
- **Course:** Flat to rolling terrain
- **Surface:** Roads, bike paths
- **Benefits:** Real-world handling, mental engagement
- **Focus:** Pacing, nutrition practice, course familiarization

## Nutrition Practice (Rides >90min)
- **Hydration:** Drink every 15-20min
- **Fuel:** 30-60g carbs/hour
- **Products:** Practice race-day nutrition
- **Timing:** Test different intake schedules

## Common Variations
- **Cadence Work:** Include 5x3min @ 100+ rpm within Z2
- **Erg Mode:** Use smart trainer for consistent power (indoor)
- **Hamburg Course:** Ride race sections (outdoor)
- **Group Rides:** Social Z2 rides (stay disciplined!)

## Progression Through Training
- **Base Phase (Weeks 1-12):** 45-90min, establish consistency
- **Build Phase (Weeks 13-20):** 60-120min, increase volume
- **Peak Phase (Weeks 21-28):** 90-150min, race-specific endurance
- **Taper (Weeks 29-30):** 45-75min, maintain fitness

## Notes
- This is the PRIMARY bike workout throughout the plan
- Consistency matters more than duration on any single ride
- Long outdoor rides: Hamburg race course sections when possible
- Indoor rides: Good opportunity to work on position and form
- Actual duration and indoor/outdoor specified in weekly schedule
- Can watch training content during indoor sessions
