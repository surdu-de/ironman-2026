# Tempo Intervals

## Description
Structured interval workout at tempo intensity (Z3). These sessions bridge the gap between easy aerobic rides and hard threshold work, building sustained power at "comfortably hard" effort. Various formats used throughout training plan.

## Common Formats

### Format 1: 3x10min @ Z3
- **Total Duration:** 75min
- **Warmup:** 15min easy, progressive build to Z2
- **Main Set:** 3x10min @ tempo (Z3)
- **Recovery:** 5min Z1-Z2 spinning between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

### Format 2: 4x8min @ Z3
- **Total Duration:** 75min
- **Warmup:** 15min easy build
- **Main Set:** 4x8min @ tempo
- **Recovery:** 4min easy between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 12min easy

### Format 3: 2x15min @ Z3
- **Total Duration:** 80min
- **Warmup:** 20min progressive
- **Main Set:** 2x15min @ tempo
- **Recovery:** 8min easy between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 15min easy

## Execution Guidelines
- **Heart Rate:** Z3 (145-165 bpm)
- **Power:** 145-165W (75-85% FTP)
- **Cadence:** 90-95 rpm
- **Effort:** RPE 6-7/10 - "moderate to moderately hard"
- **Breathing:** Elevated but controlled
- **Feel:** Sustainable for extended periods

**Key Points:**
- Start intervals at lower end of zone, build if feeling good
- Each interval should feel similar in effort
- Recovery spins truly easy - don't rush them
- Last interval should be hardest but still controlled

## Success Criteria
- Complete all prescribed intervals in power/HR range
- Maintain target cadence throughout (90-95 rpm)
- Recovery spins allow HR to drop properly
- Feel challenged but not destroyed
- Can train normally next day (easy session)

## Pacing Strategy
- **First interval:** 75-78% FTP, establish rhythm
- **Middle intervals:** 78-82% FTP, settle into tempo
- **Final interval:** 82-85% FTP, push if feeling strong

**Common mistake:** Starting too hard, fading on later intervals

## Indoor vs Outdoor

### Indoor (Preferred for precision)
- **Equipment:** Smart trainer with power meter
- **Mode:** Erg mode or resistance mode
- **Benefits:** Precise power control, consistent effort
- **Focus:** Hit power targets exactly

### Outdoor
- **Course:** Flat to rolling, minimal stops
- **Focus:** Maintain effort on hills, don't coast
- **Challenges:** Wind, traffic, terrain variations
- **Benefits:** Mental engagement, real-world practice

## Progression Through Training
- **Early build:** Shorter intervals, more recovery (3x8min, 5min recovery)
- **Mid build:** Standard formats (3x10min, 4x8min)
- **Late build:** Longer intervals or less recovery (2x15min, 3x12min)

## Recovery Needs
- **Day before:** Easy or rest
- **Day after:** Easy endurance or rest
- **Weekly frequency:** Maximum 1x per week
- **Rest week:** Skip or do very light version (2x8min)

## Common Mistakes
- **Too hard:** Pushing into Z4 threshold range
- **Too easy:** Cruising in upper Z2 instead of tempo
- **Inconsistent power:** Big variations within intervals
- **Rushed recovery:** Not spinning easy enough between intervals

## Notes
- These intervals should feel "comfortably uncomfortable"
- Easier than threshold work but harder than endurance pace
- Great for building aerobic capacity without excessive fatigue
- Can be combined with cadence work (vary 85-100 rpm)
- Actual interval format specified in weekly schedule
- Indoor preferred for consistent power execution
