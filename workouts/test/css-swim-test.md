# CSS Swim Test (Critical Swim Speed)

## Description
Critical Swim Speed (CSS) test consisting of two time trials: 400m and 200m. This test establishes your threshold swim pace and is used to set training zones for all swim workouts. Requires maximum effort and should be done fresh.

## Test Protocol
**Total Session:** 45-50 minutes

### Warmup (15-20min)
- 400m easy swimming (progressive build)
- 4x50m technique drills (catch-up, fist, fingertip drag, 6-kick switch)
- 4x50m build pace on 1:15 (each 50m slightly faster)
- 100m easy recovery
- **Goal:** Fully warmed up, feel ready

### Test 1: 400m Time Trial
- **Distance:** 400m (8 lengths of 50m pool)
- **Effort:** Maximum sustainable for 400m
- **Pacing:** Even pace - negative split if possible
- **Rest after:** 10 minutes complete recovery

**Record:** Total time for 400m (T400)

### Recovery Between Tests (10min)
- **Swim very easy:** 200-300m Z1
- **Focus:** Let heart rate drop, clear lactate
- **Mental reset:** Prepare for second time trial
- **Goal:** Ready for maximum effort again

### Test 2: 200m Time Trial
- **Distance:** 200m (4 lengths of 50m pool)
- **Effort:** Maximum sustainable for 200m
- **Pacing:** Fast but controlled throughout
- **Rest after:** Easy recovery swimming

**Record:** Total time for 200m (T200)

### Cooldown (10min)
- 400m very easy swimming
- Focus on relaxation and form
- Breathe deeply, let heart rate drop

## CSS Calculation
**Formula:** CSS pace = (T400 - T200) ÷ 2

### Example:
- T400 = 9:40 (580 seconds)
- T200 = 4:40 (280 seconds)
- CSS = (580 - 280) ÷ 2 = 150 seconds = 2:30/100m

**Your CSS pace is: 2:30 per 100m**

This pace represents your:
- Swim threshold pace
- Maximum sustainable aerobic pace
- ~1-hour race pace equivalent

## Pacing Strategy

### 400m Time Trial
- **First 100m:** Controlled (not all-out)
- **100-300m:** Settle into rhythm, maintain
- **Last 100m:** Everything you have left

**Target:** Even 100m splits or slight negative split
- Example splits: 1:12, 1:13, 1:13, 1:12 (Total: 5:00)

### 200m Time Trial
- **First 100m:** Fast but sustainable
- **Last 100m:** Push hard, empty the tank

**Target:** Even splits or slight negative split
- Example splits: 1:10, 1:09 (Total: 2:19)

## Execution Tips

### Day Before Test
- **Training:** Easy technique swim or rest
- **Sleep:** Full 8 hours minimum
- **Hydration:** Well-hydrated
- **Nutrition:** Normal, no experiments
- **Mental:** Visualize successful execution

### Test Day
- **Timing:** Morning or early evening (when fresh)
- **Food:** Light meal 2-3 hours before
- **Arrive:** 15min early, no rushing
- **Mindset:** Focused, confident, committed

### During Warmup
- **Gradual:** Don't rush warmup
- **Feel water:** Establish good catch and rhythm
- **Mental prep:** Visualize pacing strategy
- **Physical:** Feel loose and ready

### During Time Trials
- **Start controlled:** First length slightly conservative
- **Find rhythm:** Settle into sustainable pace quickly
- **Stay present:** Focus on form and rhythm
- **Finish strong:** Empty tank on final lengths
- **Count lengths:** Don't lose track!

### Between Tests
- **Don't rush:** Take full 10min recovery
- **Swim easy:** Very light active recovery
- **Reset:** 400m is done, focus on 200m
- **Prepare:** Ready for another max effort

## Recording Results

### Data to Record
1. **400m time:** MM:SS.0 (e.g., 5:45.3)
2. **200m time:** MM:SS.0 (e.g., 2:45.8)
3. **Calculated CSS:** SS/100m (e.g., 2:30/100m)
4. **Conditions:** Pool temp, how you felt, any issues
5. **Split times:** If available (100m splits for both)

### Update Training Zones
After test, recalculate all swim zones based on new CSS:
- **Z1 Recovery:** CSS + 25-30 sec/100m
- **Z2 Endurance:** CSS + 15-20 sec/100m
- **Z3 Tempo:** CSS + 5-10 sec/100m
- **Z4 Threshold:** CSS ± 5 sec/100m
- **Z5 VO2max:** CSS - 10-20 sec/100m

## Success Criteria
- Both time trials completed at maximum effort
- Pacing was reasonably controlled (no blow-up)
- Accurate time recording
- Training zones updated based on results
- Learned about current fitness level

## Common Mistakes
- **Insufficient warmup:** Going into test cold
- **Starting too fast:** Blowing up in 400m
- **Not full effort:** Holding back "just in case"
- **Insufficient recovery:** Only 5min between tests
- **Poor pacing:** Wildly uneven splits
- **Losing count:** Not tracking lengths accurately

## Comparison & Progression

### Expected CSS Improvements
- **Weeks 1-4:** Baseline established
- **Week 12:** +5-10 sec/100m improvement
- **Week 20:** +8-15 sec/100m total improvement
- **Week 28:** +10-20 sec/100m total improvement (peak)

### Ironman Race Pace Prediction
**CSS pace →** Add 10-15 sec/100m for sustainable Ironman race pace

Example:
- CSS: 2:30/100m
- Ironman pace: 2:40-2:45/100m
- Predicted 3.8km time: 1:42-1:44

## Recovery After Test
- **Same day:** Easy rest of day
- **Next day:** Very easy technique swim OR rest
- **48 hours:** Resume normal training
- **Soreness:** Normal, shows good effort

## Notes
- **Schedule:** Every 8 weeks (Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28)
- **Importance:** Critical for setting accurate zones
- **Mental:** This is hard but valuable data
- **Pool:** 50m pool results more accurate than 25m
- **Conditions:** Try to keep test conditions consistent
- **Effort:** Both tests should feel very hard
- **Honesty:** Give genuine maximum effort for accurate zones
