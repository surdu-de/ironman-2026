# FTP Bike Test (Functional Threshold Power)

## Description
Functional Threshold Power (FTP) test using the standard 20-minute protocol. This test establishes your sustainable power output and is used to set training zones for all bike workouts. Requires maximum effort and should be done fresh.

## Test Protocols
Two main protocols available - choose based on experience and testing phase:

### Protocol 1: Standard 20-Minute Test (Primary)
**Total Duration:** 60 minutes
- Most reliable for FTP measurement
- Used for Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28
- Requires excellent pacing

### Protocol 2: Garmin 3+10min Test (Alternative)
**Total Duration:** 45 minutes
- Quick assessment protocol
- Good for mid-cycle checks
- Estimates both VO2max and FTP
- Can be used Week 2 for initial baseline

## Protocol 1: Standard 20-Minute FTP Test

### Structure
1. **Warmup:** 20min progressive
2. **Primer:** 5min @ target FTP
3. **Recovery:** 5min easy spin
4. **Test:** 20min all-out effort
5. **Cooldown:** 10min easy

### Detailed Execution

**Warmup (20min)**
- 0-5min: Very easy spin, Z1 (50% FTP)
- 5-10min: Gradual build to Z2 (65% FTP)
- 10-15min: Build to Z3 (80% FTP)
- 15-18min: 3x30sec fast spin (>100 rpm)
- 18-20min: Easy Z2

**Primer (5min)**
- **Purpose:** Test pacing, prime system
- **Effort:** Current FTP or slightly above
- **Feel:** Comfortably hard, sustainable
- **Mental:** Assess readiness

**Recovery (5min)**
- Very easy spin (Z1)
- Heart rate drops below 130 bpm
- Mental reset for main effort
- Get hydrated, focused

**20-Minute Test (THE TEST)**
- **Effort:** Maximum sustainable for 20 minutes
- **Pacing:** Even power throughout (critical!)
- **Cadence:** 90-95 rpm (natural, not forced)
- **Mental:** Stay focused, present, committed
- **Goal:** Highest average power for 20min

**Cooldown (10min)**
- Very easy spin
- Let heart rate drop
- Reflect on effort

### FTP Calculation
**FTP = 95% of 20-minute average power**

Example:
- 20min avg power: 210W
- FTP = 210 × 0.95 = 200W

## Protocol 2: Garmin 3+10min Test

### Structure
1. **Warmup:** 15min progressive
2. **Test 1:** 3min all-out
3. **Recovery:** 5min easy
4. **Test 2:** 10min all-out
5. **Cooldown:** 10min easy

### Detailed Execution

**Warmup (15min)**
- 0-10min: Progressive Z1→Z2→Z3
- 10-13min: 3x30sec fast cadence
- 13-15min: Easy recovery spin

**3-Minute All-Out**
- Maximum power you can sustain for 3 minutes
- Provides max power / VO2max estimate
- Suffer hard, empty tank

**Recovery (5min)**
- Spin very easy
- Critical recovery before 10min effort

**10-Minute All-Out**
- Maximum sustainable power for 10 minutes
- This is your FTP test
- Even pacing critical

**Cooldown (10min)**
- Easy recovery spin

### FTP Calculation
**FTP = 95% of 10-minute average power**

Example:
- 10min avg power: 210W
- FTP = 210 × 0.95 = 200W

## Pacing Strategies

### 20-Minute Test Pacing
**Goal:** Dead-even power throughout

**Conservative Start**
- Minutes 1-2: Ramp to target power (don't spike)
- Minutes 2-10: Settle into rhythm at target
- Minutes 10-15: Hold power, fight any drop
- Minutes 15-18: Dig deep, maintain power
- Minutes 18-20: Everything left, push hard

**Target Split:** ~200W throughout (example)
- First 10min: 200W avg
- Second 10min: 200W avg

**Common mistake:** Starting at 220W, fading to 180W

### 10-Minute Test Pacing
**Goal:** Maximum sustainable effort

- Minutes 1-2: Build to just below max sustainable
- Minutes 2-8: Hold that power desperately
- Minutes 8-10: Somehow hold on, finish strong

Much less room for pacing errors!

## Execution Tips

### 2 Days Before Test
- **Training:** Easy ride or rest
- **Sleep:** 8+ hours both nights
- **Nutrition:** Normal, carb-loaded
- **Mental:** Visualize successful pacing

### Day Before Test
- **Training:** 30min easy spin or complete rest
- **Hydration:** Very well hydrated
- **Carbs:** Good carb intake
- **Early bed:** 8+ hours sleep

### Test Day
- **Timing:** Morning preferred (fresh)
- **Food:** Light breakfast 2-3 hours before
- **Caffeine:** Normal amount (if habituated)
- **Setup:** Fan, water, towel, music/video
- **Mindset:** Committed to maximum effort

### Equipment Setup
- **Trainer:** Smart trainer with power meter
- **Calibration:** Spin-down or calibrate before test
- **Cooling:** Multiple fans (critical!)
- **Hydration:** Water bottle accessible
- **Entertainment:** Music or motivational video
- **Data:** Display only current power and time

**Don't display:**
- Average power (leads to chasing)
- Heart rate (lags behind effort)
- Predicted FTP (mental games)

## During The Test

### Mental Approach
- **First 5min:** "This is manageable"
- **Minutes 5-10:** "Getting hard, stay committed"
- **Minutes 10-15:** "This hurts, but I can do this"
- **Minutes 15-18:** "Suffering, but nearly there"
- **Final 2min:** "Give everything I have left"

### Physical Cues
- **Cadence:** Hold 90-95 rpm (don't grind)
- **Position:** Stay in aero if testing race position
- **Breathing:** Heavy but controlled
- **Focus:** Power number, keeping it steady

### When It Gets Hard
- **Break it down:** Count to 60, then repeat
- **Focus present:** This moment, this pedal stroke
- **Remember why:** This data drives training
- **Embrace suck:** Champions are forged here

## Recording Results

### Data to Record
1. **Average power:** 20min (or 10min) average watts
2. **Normalized power:** If available
3. **Calculated FTP:** 95% of test power
4. **Average heart rate:** From test effort
5. **Average cadence:** Rpm during test
6. **Conditions:** How you felt, any issues
7. **Power curve:** If available (see fade pattern)

### Update Training Zones
After test, recalculate all bike zones based on new FTP:
- **Z1 Active Recovery:** <56% FTP
- **Z2 Endurance:** 56-75% FTP
- **Z3 Tempo:** 75-90% FTP
- **Z4 Threshold:** 91-105% FTP
- **Z5 VO2max:** 106-120% FTP
- **Z6 Anaerobic:** >120% FTP

### Update Training Zones File
`[[training-zones#Bike Zones]]` - manually update with new FTP

## Success Criteria
- Test completed at genuine maximum effort
- Pacing was controlled (no catastrophic fade)
- Power output steady throughout test
- Feel completely emptied at finish
- Accurate data recorded
- Training zones updated

## Expected FTP Improvements
- **Week 4 (Baseline):** Establish starting FTP
- **Week 12:** +10-20W improvement (5-10%)
- **Week 20:** +15-30W total improvement (8-15%)
- **Week 28 (Peak):** +20-40W total improvement (10-20%)

Example progression:
- Week 4: 195W FTP
- Week 12: 210W FTP (+15W)
- Week 20: 220W FTP (+25W total)
- Week 28: 230W FTP (+35W total)

## Ironman Race Power Prediction
**FTP →** Race at 70-75% of FTP for 180km

Example:
- FTP: 200W
- Ironman target: 140-150W
- Predicted bike split: 6:00-6:30 (depends on course)

## Common Mistakes
- **Insufficient warmup:** Starting test cold
- **Starting too hard:** Massive fade in final minutes
- **Not pacing:** Wild power variations
- **Poor cooling:** Overheating affects power
- **Giving up:** Not truly emptying the tank
- **Wrong protocol:** Using ramp test for FTP
- **Too frequent:** Testing more than every 8 weeks

## Recovery After Test
- **Same day:** Easy spinning only
- **Next day:** Very easy ride OR rest
- **48 hours:** Resume normal training
- **Legs dead:** Normal, shows proper effort

## Notes
- **Indoor strongly preferred:** Controlled conditions, no interruptions
- **Schedule:** Every 8 weeks (Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28)
- **Importance:** Critical for accurate training zones
- **Mental:** This should hurt - embrace it
- **Power meter:** Consistent power meter critical
- **Comparison:** Test conditions similar each time
- **Honesty:** True maximum effort required for accurate zones
- **Alternative:** Garmin 3+10min test for Week 2 initial assessment
