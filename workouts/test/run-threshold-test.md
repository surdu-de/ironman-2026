# Run Threshold Test (30-Minute Time Trial)

## Description
30-minute time trial to establish lactate threshold pace and heart rate. This test determines your sustainable hard running pace and is used to set training zones for all run workouts. Requires maximum effort and should be done fresh.

## Test Protocol
**Total Session:** 55-65 minutes

### Structure
1. **Warmup:** 15min easy progressive
2. **Test:** 30min maximum sustainable effort
3. **Cooldown:** 10min easy

### Detailed Execution

**Warmup (15min)**
- **0-5min:** Very easy jog, Z1 (conversational)
- **5-10min:** Build to easy Z2 pace
- **10-13min:** 3x30sec strides with full recovery
  - Quick turnover, smooth form
  - Walk/jog 60-90sec between
- **13-15min:** Easy jogging, shake out legs
- **Goal:** Fully warmed up, muscles loose, ready

**30-Minute Time Trial (THE TEST)**
- **Effort:** Maximum sustainable for 30 minutes
- **Pacing:** Even pace throughout (critical!)
- **Cadence:** Natural (typically 85-90 spm)
- **Mental:** Stay focused and committed
- **Goal:** Cover maximum distance in 30 minutes

**Record:**
- Total distance covered
- Average pace (min/km)
- Average heart rate
- Splits (if possible)

**Cooldown (10min)**
- Very easy jogging
- Let heart rate drop naturally
- Walk if needed
- Reflect on effort

## Threshold Calculations

### Threshold Pace
**Threshold Pace = Average pace for 30min**

Example:
- Distance covered: 6.0km in 30min
- Average pace: 5:00/km
- **Threshold pace = 5:00/km**

### Threshold Heart Rate
**Threshold HR = Average HR for last 20min of test**

Example:
- Last 20min average HR: 165 bpm
- **Threshold HR = 165 bpm (92% HRmax)**

### Use for Training Zones
This threshold pace is your:
- **Z4 threshold pace**
- **1-hour race pace**
- **Hard but sustainable pace**

## Pacing Strategy

### Even Pace Approach (Recommended)
**Goal:** Dead-even kilometer splits

- **Minutes 0-2:** Build smoothly to target pace (don't spike!)
- **Minutes 2-15:** Settle into rhythm, feels manageable
- **Minutes 15-25:** Getting hard, stay committed
- **Minutes 25-30:** Dig deep, finish strong

**Example splits for 5:00/km target:**
- Km 1: 5:05 (conservative start)
- Km 2-5: 5:00, 5:00, 4:58, 5:00
- Km 6: 4:55 (everything left)

**Result:** 6.0km in 30:00 (5:00/km avg)

### Negative Split Approach (Advanced)
- **First 15min:** Slightly conservative (~5-10 sec/km slower)
- **Last 15min:** Push harder, drop pace
- **Finish:** Fastest final 5 minutes

**Common mistake:** Starting at 4:45/km, fading to 5:20/km

## Course Selection

### Ideal Test Course
- **Flat:** Minimal elevation change (<20m total)
- **Measurable:** GPS accurate or measured track
- **Uninterrupted:** No traffic lights or stops
- **Surface:** Even pavement or track
- **Safe:** Good footing, well-lit if evening
- **Familiar:** Know the course (reduces stress)

### Track vs Road

**Track (400m)**
- **Pros:** Perfectly flat, accurate distance, even surface
- **Cons:** Boring, mentally challenging, repetitive
- **Laps:** 7.5 laps in 30min
- **Pacing:** Very easy to monitor (lap splits)

**Road (Out-and-back or loop)**
- **Pros:** Mental stimulation, realistic conditions
- **Cons:** Slight elevation, GPS accuracy, turns
- **Route:** 3-3.5km out, turn, return
- **Pacing:** Use GPS or kilometer markers

## Execution Tips

### 2 Days Before Test
- **Training:** Easy run or rest
- **Sleep:** 8+ hours both nights
- **Nutrition:** Normal carb intake
- **Mental:** Visualize strong pacing

### Day Before Test
- **Training:** 30min easy jog or complete rest
- **Hydration:** Well hydrated
- **Carbs:** Good dinner
- **Sleep:** 8+ hours
- **Stress:** Minimize

### Test Day Morning
- **Timing:** Mid-morning ideal (9-11am)
- **Food:** Light breakfast 2-3 hours before
  - Toast with honey

- **Bathroom:** Plan timing!

### Test Conditions
- **Weather:** Mild temps preferred (10-18°C)
- **Wind:** Minimal if possible
- **Heat:** Avoid hot afternoon (affects HR/pace)
- **Rain:** Light rain OK, heavy rain postpone
- **Course:** Pre-run the route if unfamiliar

### Equipment
- **Shoes:** Race or tempo shoes (not trainers)
- **Watch:** GPS enabled, current pace display
- **Clothes:** Minimal, race-day type clothing
- **Fuel:** Not needed for 30min
- **Water:** Small sip before, not during

## During The Test

### Mental Approach
- **Minutes 0-5:** "Finding rhythm, staying controlled"
- **Minutes 5-15:** "This is manageable, stay focused"
- **Minutes 15-23:** "Getting hard, but committed"
- **Minutes 23-28:** "This hurts, embrace it"
- **Final 2min:** "Empty the tank completely"

### Physical Cues
- **Breathing:** Hard but rhythmic (not gasping)
- **Form:** Upright, relaxed shoulders, quick turnover
- **Cadence:** Natural (don't force high cadence)
- **Effort:** RPE 8-9/10 throughout
- **Focus:** Pace, form, breathing

### When It Gets Hard (It Will!)
- **Break it down:** "Just get to 20 minutes"
- **Stay present:** This kilometer, this moment
- **Form focus:** Relaxed face, strong arms
- **Remember purpose:** This data drives training
- **Embrace suck:** This is where growth happens

## Recording Results

### Data to Record
1. **Total distance:** Kilometers covered in 30min
2. **Average pace:** Min/km for entire 30min
3. **Threshold pace:** Same as average pace
4. **Average HR:** Entire 30min
5. **Threshold HR:** Last 20min average
6. **Split data:** Kilometer or lap splits
7. **Conditions:** Weather, course, how felt
8. **Max HR:** Peak heart rate during test

### Calculate Training Zones

Based on threshold pace and HR, update:

**Pace-Based Zones (using 5:00/km threshold example):**
- **Z1 Easy:** 6:15-6:45/km (threshold + 75-105 sec)
- **Z2 Aerobic:** 5:45-6:15/km (threshold + 45-75 sec)
- **Z3 Tempo:** 5:15-5:45/km (threshold + 15-45 sec)
- **Z4 Threshold:** 4:50-5:10/km (threshold ± 10 sec)
- **Z5 VO2max:** 4:30-4:50/km (threshold - 10-30 sec)

**HR-Based Zones (using 165 bpm threshold @ 92% HRmax):**
- **Z1:** <75% HRmax (<134 bpm)
- **Z2:** 75-85% HRmax (134-152 bpm)
- **Z3:** 85-90% HRmax (152-161 bpm)
- **Z4:** 91-95% HRmax (162-170 bpm)
- **Z5:** >95% HRmax (>170 bpm)

### Update Training Zones File
`[[training-zones#Run Zones]]` - manually update

## Success Criteria
- Test completed at genuine maximum effort
- Pacing was controlled (no catastrophic fade)
- Splits reasonably even throughout
- Feel completely emptied at finish
- Accurate data recorded
- Training zones updated
- Can barely speak after finish

## Expected Threshold Improvements

### Pace Progression Example
- **Week 4 (Baseline):** 5:15/km threshold
- **Week 12:** 5:05/km threshold (+10 sec/km)
- **Week 20:** 4:55/km threshold (+20 sec/km total)
- **Week 28 (Peak):** 4:45/km threshold (+30 sec/km total)

### Distance Progression Example
- **Week 4:** 5.7km in 30min
- **Week 12:** 5.9km in 30min
- **Week 20:** 6.1km in 30min
- **Week 28:** 6.3km in 30min

## Ironman Marathon Pace Prediction
**Threshold Pace →** Add 45-60 sec/km for Ironman run pace

Example:
- Threshold: 5:00/km
- Ironman target: 5:45-6:00/km
- Predicted marathon: 4:03-4:13 (42.2km)

## Common Mistakes
- **Insufficient warmup:** Starting test cold
- **Starting too fast:** Massive fade in final 10min
- **Not pacing:** Wild variations in splits
- **Wrong course:** Hilly or interrupted route
- **Too frequent:** Testing more than every 8 weeks
- **Not max effort:** Holding back "in reserve"
- **Giving up:** Slowing when it hurts instead of fighting

## Recovery After Test
- **Same day:** Easy rest of day, maybe easy swim
- **Next day:** 30min easy recovery run OR rest
- **48 hours:** Resume normal training
- **Soreness:** Normal in quads/calves
