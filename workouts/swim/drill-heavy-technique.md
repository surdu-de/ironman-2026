# Drill-Heavy Technique

## Description
High-percentage drill session (30-50% drills) specifically designed to improve catch and pull mechanics. Combines extensive drill work with pull buoy sets that isolate upper body mechanics. Focus is on perfect movement patterns, not intensity or speed. This is the primary workout type for developing efficient catch, high elbow position, and powerful pull-through.

## Drill Descriptions

### Catch-Up Drill (Primary: Extension & Timing)
**Purpose:** Develops full arm extension, patient timing, proper catch position
**Execution:**
- One arm extends forward while other completes full stroke
- Wait for hands to "catch up" before starting next stroke
- Focus on full extension, patient pause, then powerful catch

**Key Points:**
- Extension should be underwater (not splashing surface)
- Feel the catch position before pulling
- Maintain streamline during pause

### Fist Drill (Primary: Forearm Engagement)
**Purpose:** Develops awareness of forearm as propulsive surface (Early Vertical Forearm)
**Execution:**
- Make tight fists with both hands
- Swim normally with closed fists
- Feel forearm catching and pulling water

**Key Points:**
- Elbow MUST stay high to catch water
- Forearm becomes the "paddle"
- Immediate transfer to better catch with open hands

### Single-Arm Drill (Primary: Stroke Completion)
**Purpose:** Full stroke mechanics, catch-to-finish, body rotation
**Execution:**
- One arm extended forward (non-working arm)
- Other arm completes full stroke cycle
- Breathe to working arm side

**Key Points:**
- Complete the stroke fully (hand past hip)
- Maintain body rotation
- High elbow throughout pull phase

### Fingertip Drag (Primary: High Elbow Recovery)
**Purpose:** Reinforces high elbow position during recovery phase
**Execution:**
- Trail fingertips along water surface during arm recovery
- Elbow stays high throughout recovery
- Hand relaxed, elbow leads

**Key Points:**
- Elbow is highest point (not hand or shoulder)
- Continuous light contact with water
- Relaxed hand/wrist

### Sculling (Primary: Wrist/Forearm Feel)
**Purpose:** Develops "feel for the water," hand pitch awareness
**Execution:**
- Hands in front, make figure-8 patterns
- Feel constant pressure on hands/forearms
- Small movements, big propulsion

**Key Points:**
- Slight pitch change with each direction
- Constant tension on forearms
- Minimal arm movement, maximum feel

### 6-Kick Switch (Primary: Rotation & Streamline)
**Purpose:** Body position, rotation mechanics, balance
**Execution:**
- 6 kicks on side (bottom arm extended, top arm at side)
- Take 3 strokes
- 6 kicks on opposite side

**Key Points:**
- Perfect streamline on side
- Look at pool bottom (not forward)
- Smooth rotation between sides

## Pull Buoy Set Execution

**Purpose:** Isolate upper body mechanics, build catch/pull power without leg interference

**Standard Paces:**
- Easy focus: 2:40-2:50/100m
- Moderate focus: 2:35-2:40/100m
- Higher intensity: 2:30-2:35/100m (closer to CSS)

**Key Points:**
- NO kicking - legs completely relaxed
- Focus 100% on upper body mechanics
- High elbow catch (elbow higher than hand)
- Vertical forearm pull (EVF)
- Complete stroke finish (hand past hip)
- Shoulder-driven rotation

**Common Mistakes:**
- Kicking with pull buoy (defeats purpose)
- Dropping elbow during catch (low elbow)
- Short pull (not finishing stroke)
- Flat body position (no rotation)

## Catch & Pull Focus Areas

### The Catch
**Goal:** Establish high elbow position, forearm vertical
- Hand enters slightly in front of shoulder
- Fingertips down, elbow up
- "Catch" water with forearm, not just hand
- Feel like climbing over barrel

### The Pull
**Goal:** Maximize propulsion through mid-stroke
- Forearm stays vertical (perpendicular to pool bottom)
- Elbow high throughout pull phase
- Hand accelerates from catch to finish
- Pull path: Slight S-curve or straight line (personal)

### The Finish
**Goal:** Complete stroke fully, maximize propulsion
- Hand finishes past hip
- Acceleration through finish (don't quit early)
- Clean hand exit (thumb grazes thigh)
- Immediate recovery to high elbow

## Success Criteria
- Complete all drill reps with perfect form
- Pull buoy sets maintain target pace ±2s/100m
- Feel improvement in catch mechanics
- Zero added fatigue (RPE stays 3-4/10)
- Technique feels better at end than start

## When to Use This Workout

**Weekly Frequency:** 2-3 times per week
- Tuesday: Drill-heavy session (evening after work, before Thu)
- Thursday: Mixed technique + threshold (20:00 fixed session)
- Sunday: Drill-heavy session (morning before long run)

**Training Phase:**
- **Build weeks:** 2-3 sessions, maintain high drill %
- **Recovery weeks:** 1-2 sessions, even higher drill % (60%+)
- **Taper:** Daily light drill sessions

## Progression Strategy
**DO NOT:**
- Reduce drill percentage as fitness improves
- Swim drills faster (defeats purpose)
- Skip drills to "get more swimming in"

**DO:**
- Maintain 30-50% drill volume year-round
- Increase pull buoy distances (300m → 500m continuous)
- Add complexity (combine drill elements)
- Film technique quarterly to track improvement

## Integration with Other Swim Sessions

**This workout (Tue/Sun):** 30-50% drills + pull buoy
**Thursday threshold:** 25-30% drills + main set + pull buoy finisher
**Total weekly drill volume:** 1800-2200m drills, 700-1100m pull buoy

## Pace Guidelines
- **Drills:** Slow and perfect (3:00-3:30/100m equivalent - VERY slow)
- **Pull buoy:** 2:35-2:40/100m (relaxed but engaged)
- **Continuous swimming:** 2:40-2:45/100m (smooth, apply drill concepts)
- **Overall effort:** RPE 3-4/10 (very easy, meditative)

**If breathing hard:** YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST - slow down

## Mental Approach
- **Curiosity:** What happens if I change hand pitch?
- **Internal focus:** How does catch feel? Where's my elbow?
- **Patience:** Technique develops slowly, trust process
- **Enjoyment:** This is skill practice, not suffering
- **Experimentation:** Try slight variations, find what works

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Rushing drills:** Defeats entire purpose
- **Low drill percentage:** <30% not enough stimulus
- **Kicking with pull buoy:** Removes isolation benefit
- **Skipping rest:** Need recovery between drill reps
- **Mindless repetition:** Must actively focus on technique
- **Comparing:** Others swimming "faster" - irrelevant

## Video Analysis
**Perfect workout for filming:**
- Have someone film your stroke
- Focus on catch and pull mechanics
- Compare to previous footage
- Identify specific improvements needed
- Film every 4-6 weeks to track progress

## Notes
- This workout should feel almost embarrassingly easy
- Pace is irrelevant - perfect form is everything
- Drill volume (30-50%) is non-negotiable
- Pull buoy work essential for isolating catch/pull
- Best session for mental break from hard training
- Most valuable session for long-term improvement
- Actual format specified in weekly schedule
- When tired, increase drill %, reduce continuous swimming
- Quality >>> quantity >>> speed
