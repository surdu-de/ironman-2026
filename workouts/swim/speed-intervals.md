# Speed Intervals

## Description
High-intensity intervals focused on developing speed and power in the water. These sessions train the ability to sustain faster-than-race pace efforts while maintaining good technique. Various formats targeting different energy systems and race pacing.

## Common Formats

### Format 1: Short Speed (50m focus)
- **Total Distance:** 1400m
- **Warmup:** 300m progressive build
- **Main Set 1:** 8x50m @ fast pace, 1:15-1:30 rest
  - Target: 2:25-2:35/100m pace
  - Focus: Quick turnover, powerful catch
- **Recovery:** 2min easy swimming
- **Main Set 2:** 4x100m @ moderate-fast, 2:30 rest
  - Target: 2:35-2:40/100m pace
  - Focus: Sustained speed, form hold
- **Cooldown:** 200m easy

### Format 2: Mixed Speed
- **Total Distance:** 1500m
- **Warmup:** 400m (200 easy, 200 build)
- **Main Set:** 10x100m descending pace, 2:15 rest
  - #1-3: 2:45/100m (moderate)
  - #4-6: 2:40/100m (moderate-fast)
  - #7-10: 2:30-2:35/100m (fast)
- **Cooldown:** 200m easy

### Format 3: Pyramid Speed
- **Total Distance:** 1600m
- **Warmup:** 400m progressive
- **Main Set:**
  - 4x50m @ fast (1:20 rest)
  - 3x100m @ moderate-fast (2:00 rest)
  - 2x200m @ tempo (2:30 rest)
  - 1x400m @ steady (3:00 rest)
- **Cooldown:** 200m easy

## Execution Guidelines
- **Pace Range:** 2:20-2:40/100m (depends on interval length)
- **Effort:** RPE 7-9/10 (harder for shorter intervals)
- **Stroke Rate:** Higher than endurance pace
- **Breathing:** Controlled but elevated
- **Technique:** Maintain form even when tired

**Key Focus:**
- **Catch:** Powerful water catch at front
- **Pull:** Strong through entire stroke
- **Finish:** Drive through to hips
- **Body position:** Stay streamlined despite effort
- **Turnover:** Quick recovery, minimize glide time

## Success Criteria
- Hit target pace ranges consistently
- Maintain technique throughout (no breakdown)
- Complete all prescribed intervals
- Breathing controlled and rhythmic
- Feel challenged but accomplished

## Pacing Strategy
- **50m intervals:** 90-95% max effort, very fast
- **100m intervals:** 85-90% effort, sustainable speed
- **200m+ intervals:** 80-85% effort, controlled speed

**Common mistake:** Going all-out too early and fading badly

## Rest Intervals
- **Short rest (1:15-1:30):** Keeps intensity high, less recovery
- **Standard rest (2:00-2:30):** Balanced recovery and intensity
- **Long rest (2:30-3:00):** Full recovery for quality

Wall touch → immediate check of watch → rest starts

## Technique Emphasis During Speed
Despite higher intensity, maintain:
- **High elbow catch:** Don't drop elbow when tired
- **Hip rotation:** Core engaged, not flat
- **Streamline:** Minimize drag
- **Breathing pattern:** Rhythmic (usually bilateral every 3-5 strokes)

## Pool 50m Considerations
- **Flip turns:** Practice efficient turns, gain speed
- **Pacing:** First 25m controlled, second 25m maintain/build
- **Walls:** Legal touch, quick push-off
- **Sighting:** Not needed for pool intervals

## Progression Through Training
- **Early build:** Shorter intervals, more rest (8x50m)
- **Mid build:** Mixed formats (50s + 100s)
- **Race prep:** Longer speed intervals (6x100m, 4x200m)

## Recovery Needs
- **Day before:** Easy swim or rest
- **Day after:** Technique swim or rest
- **Weekly frequency:** 1x per week maximum
- **Rest week:** Skip or very light version (4x50m easy-fast)

## Common Mistakes
- **Starting too fast:** First interval too aggressive
- **Technique breakdown:** Sacrificing form for speed
- **Insufficient rest:** Rushing between intervals
- **Inconsistent pacing:** Big variations between reps
- **Skipping warmup:** Starting main set cold

## Notes
- Speed work is high-quality, low-volume
- Technique must be maintained even at speed
- Rest intervals are part of the workout - take them fully
- Better to nail fewer reps perfectly than struggle through many
- 50m pool allows for realistic Ironman pace work (long swims)
- Actual format specified in weekly schedule
- Stop set if technique breaks down significantly
