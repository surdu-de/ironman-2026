# Catch & Pull Technique Session 1400m

## Description
Focused swim session emphasizing catch and pull mechanics. Uses specific drills to develop forearm awareness and high elbow catch position before applying techniques in moderate-paced intervals.

## Execution
- **Duration:** ~45 minutes
- **Distance:** 1400m
- **Pool:** 50m
- **Pace:** 2:25-2:45/100m for main set
- **Rest:** 20-30s between intervals

**Structure:**

### Warmup (200m)
- 200m easy freestyle, focus on feel for the water

---

### Catch & Pull Drills (400m = 8x50m @ 1:15)

**2x50m Fist Drill:**
- Swim freestyle with **closed fists** (thumbs tucked in)
- Forces you to use your forearms, not just hands, to catch water
- Feel the pressure on your entire forearm, not just palm
- *Why:* Teaches forearm awareness - your forearm should be part of your paddle
- When you open fists again, you'll feel much more surface area

**2x50m Sculling Drill:**
- Extend arms forward, hands at surface
- Move hands side-to-side in small figure-8 patterns
- Keep elbows stationary, only hands/forearms move
- Feel constant pressure on palms and forearms
- Move forward using only this sculling motion (no kicking)
- *Why:* Develops feel for water pressure and how to maintain grip throughout pull

**2x50m Catch-up Drill:**
- One arm stays extended forward while other arm completes full stroke
- Wait until recovering arm "catches up" and touches the extended hand
- Then switch - extended arm pulls while other arm waits
- **Exaggerate** the high elbow position during the catch phase
- *Why:* Isolates each arm's catch, lets you focus on proper entry and catch position

**2x50m Single-arm Freestyle:**
- One arm stays at side, other arm does full freestyle stroke
- Alternate arms each 25m (or 50m if you prefer)
- Focus on the **complete sequence**: entry → catch → pull → push → recovery
- Keep non-working arm relaxed at your side
- *Why:* Lets you feel the entire pull sequence without distraction

---

### Main Set (600m = 3x200m @ 3:45)
**Focus: Apply what you learned in drills**

- Pace: Easy Z2 (2:25-2:45/100m)
- Rest: 20-30s between each 200m
- **Mental cues:**
  - "Catch water early, press it back, finish at hip"
  - "High elbow, vertical forearm"
  - "Feel the water with forearm, not just hand"

---

### Cooldown (100m)
- 100m easy choice of strokes
- Reflect on improvements you felt during main set

---

## Catch & Pull Key Points

**Key Technique Focus:**
1. **High elbow catch:** Fingertips point down to pool bottom, elbow stays high near surface
2. **Early vertical forearm (EVF):** Get your forearm perpendicular to the bottom quickly after entry
3. **Full pull:** Don't release early - push water all the way past your hip
4. **Use your forearm:** It's not just your hand - your whole forearm is your paddle
5. **Rotation:** Use core rotation to add power to the pull

**Common Mistakes:**
- Dropping elbow during catch (keeps hand flat instead of vertical)
- Releasing pull too early (missing last 30% of power)
- Using only hand, not engaging forearm
- Straight arm pull (loses leverage and power)

## Success Criteria
- Feel increased pressure on forearm, not just hand
- Maintain high elbow position throughout pull
- Stroke feels more powerful with less effort
- Pace stays consistent in main set (±3 seconds per 100m)

## Common Variations
- **Shorter:** 1200m (reduce main set to 2x200m + 2x100m)
- **Longer:** 1800m (increase to 4x200m or 5x200m)
- **Equipment Focus:** Add pull buoy for 1-2 main set intervals to isolate upper body
- **Advanced:** Add paddles for final 200m to emphasize catch power (only if technique is solid)

## Progression Path
1. **Week 1-2:** Master this 1400m workout with focus on feeling the catch
2. **Week 3-4:** Add 200m to main set (4x200m = 1600m total)
3. **Week 5+:** Progress to full 2000m technique session once comfortable

## Notes
- Perfect for Week 1 base building
- Reduced volume allows focus on quality over quantity
- Catch and pull form the foundation of efficient swimming
- Technique before intensity always
- Can be repeated 2-3 times per week during base phase
