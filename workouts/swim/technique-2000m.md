# Technique Session 2000m

## Description
Focused swim session emphasizing stroke technique and efficiency. Uses drills and moderate-paced intervals to reinforce proper form before building volume.

## Execution
- **Duration:** ~60 minutes
- **Distance:** 2000m
- **Pool:** 50m
- **Pace:** 2:20-2:40/100m for main set
- **Rest:** 15-20s between intervals

**Structure:**

**Warmup (400m):**
- 200m easy freestyle
- 100m backstroke
- 100m choice

**Drills (400m = 8x50m @ 1:15):**
- 2x50m catch-up drill
- 2x50m fingertip drag
- 2x50m single-arm freestyle
- 2x50m 6-3-6 breathing pattern

**Main Set (800m = 4x200m @ 3:45):**
- Focus: Smooth, efficient stroke
- Pace: Z2 steady (2:20-2:40/100m)
- Think about: High elbow catch, rotation, streamline

**Cooldown (200m):**
- 200m easy choice of strokes

## Success Criteria
- Maintain technique focus throughout
- Pace stays consistent in main set
- Stroke count remains stable (±2 strokes per 50m)
- Feel efficient and smooth, not fatigued

## Common Variations
- **Shorter:** 1600m (reduce main set to 3x200m)
- **Longer:** 2400m (increase to 6x200m or add 4x100m)
- **Drill Focus:** Swap drill set based on technique needs
- **Equipment:** Add pull buoy or paddles for 2 main set intervals

## Technique Reminders
**Key Points:**
- Head position: Look down, not forward
- High elbow catch: Fingertips point to bottom
- Rotation: Roll from hips, not shoulders
- Kick: Gentle, ankle flexibility, from hips
- Breathing: Exhale underwater, quick inhale

**Stroke Count:**
- Count strokes per 50m
- Aim for consistency (lower is more efficient)
- Target: 16-18 strokes/50m (varies by height)

## Notes
- This is foundational for all swim training
- Technique before intensity always
- Good for active recovery between harder swim sessions
- Can be done day after VO2max swim work
