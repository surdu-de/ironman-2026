# VO2max Intervals 2200m

## Description
High-intensity swim session targeting VO2max development. Uses structured intervals at T4 and T5 paces to build speed and lactate clearance.

## Execution
- **Duration:** ~60 minutes
- **Distance:** 2200m
- **Pool:** 50m
- **Intensity:** T4 (2:10-2:15/100m) and T5 (<1:55/50m)

**Structure:**

**Warmup (400m):**
- 400m easy freestyle, build from 50% to 75% effort
- Last 100m at Z2 pace

**Pre-main Set (600m = 6x100m @ 2:00):**
- Focus: Technique at moderate pace
- 2x100m smooth freestyle
- 2x100m with 4 underwater dolphin kicks off walls
- 2x100m build effort 50% → 85%

**Main Set (1000m = 4x300m @ 5:30 rest):**
- **Target Pace:** T4 (2:10-2:15/100m = 6:30-6:45 per 300m)
- **Effort:** Hard but sustainable, ~Z2-Z3 heart rate feel
- **Focus:** Maintain pace across all 4 intervals
- **Rest:** 60-90s between intervals

**Alternative Main Set (for progression):**
- 10x100m @ T4 (2:10-2:15/100m) with 20s rest
- 8x50m @ T5 (<1:55/50m) with 30s rest

**Cooldown (200m):**
- 200m very easy, focus on long gliding strokes

## Success Criteria
- Hit target paces for main set intervals
- Pace stays consistent across intervals (±5s)
- Technique holds up even when fatigued
- Heart rate elevated but controlled

## Common Variations
- **Build Phase:** 4x300m @ T4 (current)
- **Peak Phase:** 5x300m @ T4 or add T5 50m sprints
- **Recovery Week:** 3x300m @ T4 or reduce to T3 pace
- **Testing Week:** CSS test protocol

## Training Zones Reference
- **T4 (Threshold):** 2:10-2:15/100m - Hard but sustainable
- **T5 (VO2max):** <1:55/50m - Nearly maximal effort
- **CSS (Critical Swim Speed):** Based on testing, baseline 2:33/100m

## Notes
- Key intensity session for swim speed development
- Quality over quantity - nail the target paces
- If sick or very fatigued, substitute with technique session
- This workout is your primary speed development tool
