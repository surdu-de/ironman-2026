# Easy Technique

## Description
Low-intensity session focused on technique work and active recovery. The goal is to reinforce good movement patterns, work on specific technical elements, and promote recovery without adding training stress. Quality of movement matters infinitely more than pace or intensity.

## Common Formats

### Format 1: Drill-Focused
- **Total Distance:** 1000m
- **Warmup:** 300m very easy (gradual build)
- **Drill Set:** 6x50m technique drills, 1:15 rest
  - 2x catch-up drill (focus: extension and timing)
  - 2x fist drill (focus: forearm engagement)
  - 2x 6-kick switch (focus: body position)
- **Continuous:** 200m smooth swimming @ 2:45-2:50/100m
  - Apply drill concepts to full stroke
- **Cooldown:** 200m very easy

### Format 2: Mixed Technique
- **Total Distance:** 1200m
- **Warmup:** 300m easy (breathe every 3-5)
- **Main Set:** 8x50m alternating, 1:15-1:30 rest
  - Odd: Drill (rotate through 4 different drills)
  - Even: Smooth swimming (apply drill focus)
- **Continuous:** 4x100m easy swimming, 2:15 rest
  - Target: 2:40-2:45/100m
  - Focus: Long smooth strokes
- **Cooldown:** 200m very easy

### Format 3: Pre-Test Preparation
- **Total Distance:** 1000m
- **Warmup:** 300m very easy progressive
- **Technique Set:** 6x50m drills, 1:15 rest
  - 2x catch-up (extension)
  - 2x fingertip drag (recovery)
  - 2x 6-kick switch (rotation)
- **Smooth Swimming:** 200m continuous easy
  - Target: 2:45-2:50/100m
  - Focus: Relaxed and smooth
- **Cooldown:** 200m very easy

## Execution Guidelines
- **Pace:** 2:45-3:00/100m (SLOW and controlled)
- **Effort:** RPE 3-5/10 (very easy)
- **Stroke Rate:** Lower than normal (fewer strokes per length)
- **Breathing:** Relaxed, natural
- **Mental Focus:** Internal awareness of movement

**Key Principles:**
- Quality over everything else
- Slow down to feel the water
- Think about each movement
- No rushing, no racing
- Perfect practice makes perfect

## Common Drills

### Catch-Up Drill
- **Purpose:** Timing, extension, rotation
- **Execution:** One arm extends while other completes stroke
- **Focus:** Full extension, patient timing

### Fist Drill
- **Purpose:** Forearm awareness, high elbow
- **Execution:** Make fists, swim normally
- **Focus:** Feel forearm catching water

### Fingertip Drag
- **Purpose:** High elbow recovery
- **Execution:** Trail fingertips along surface during recovery
- **Focus:** Elbow stays high throughout recovery

### 6-Kick Switch
- **Purpose:** Body rotation, streamline
- **Execution:** 6 kicks on side, 3 strokes, 6 kicks other side
- **Focus:** Balance, rotation, streamline position

### Single-Arm Swimming
- **Purpose:** Stroke mechanics, catch
- **Execution:** Swim with one arm, other extended
- **Focus:** Full stroke completion, rotation

## Success Criteria
- Feel relaxed and loose throughout
- Technique improvements noticed
- Zero fatigue added
- Mental clarity maintained
- Form better than when started

## When to Use

### Recovery Day
- Day after hard swim session
- Between intense training blocks
- During recovery weeks

### Pre-Test
- 1-2 days before CSS or time trial
- Prime movement patterns
- Activate without fatiguing

### Technique Focus Period
- Dedicate time to form refinement
- Break bad habits
- Reinforce good patterns

## Technical Focus Areas

### Catch & Pull
- High elbow position
- Forearm vertical (EVF)
- Hand pitch/angle
- Pull path (S-curve or straight)

### Body Position
- Horizontal alignment
- Hip height
- Head position
- Streamline

### Rotation
- Hip-driven rotation
- Shoulder alignment
- Core engagement
- Balance

### Breathing
- Head turn (not lift)
- Timing with stroke
- Bilateral comfort
- Exhalation underwater

## Pace Guidelines
- **Too fast if:** Heart rate elevated, breathing noticeable
- **Right pace if:** Could swim for hours, perfectly relaxed
- **Can be slower:** 3:00+/100m is fine - slower is often better

Quality of movement >> pace >> distance

## Common Mistakes
- **Swimming too fast:** Defeats recovery purpose
- **Rushing drills:** Missing the point of technique work
- **Skipping rest:** Not taking breaks between drill sets
- **No focus:** Going through motions mindlessly
- **Comparing:** Watching others, feeling "slow"

## Mental Approach
- **Meditation in motion:** Use this as moving meditation
- **Internal focus:** How does this feel?
- **Curiosity:** What happens if I change X?
- **Patience:** Let technique develop naturally
- **Enjoyment:** Remember why you love swimming

## Video Analysis Opportunity
This is perfect session to:
- Have someone film your stroke
- Review form afterwards
- Identify areas for improvement
- Compare to previous footage

## Notes
- This should feel almost embarrassingly easy
- If anyone asks, you're "working on technique" (you are!)
- Can be shortened to 800m or extended to 1400m
- Perfect mental break from hard training
- Reinforces good habits when not fatigued
- Actual distance/format specified in weekly schedule
- When tired, focus on drills, skip continuous swimming
- This is valuable training, not "junk miles"
