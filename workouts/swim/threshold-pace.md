# Threshold Pace

## Description
Sustained moderate-hard efforts at or near lactate threshold. These sessions improve the ability to hold race pace for extended periods while managing lactate accumulation. Critical for Ironman swim pacing where you need sustained, controlled effort.

## Common Formats

### Format 1: Standard Threshold
- **Total Distance:** 1400m
- **Warmup:** 300m progressive build
- **Main Set:** 5x100m @ threshold pace, 2:15 rest
  - Target: 2:35-2:40/100m
  - Focus: Smooth, sustainable speed
- **Recovery:** 1min easy swimming
- **Main Set 2:** 6x50m @ faster pace, 1:15 rest
  - Target: 2:25-2:30/100m
  - Focus: Powerful finish
- **Cooldown:** 200m easy

### Format 2: Descending Threshold
- **Total Distance:** 1600m
- **Warmup:** 400m (200 easy, 200 build)
- **Main Set:** 8x100m descending pace, 2:00 rest
  - #1-2: 2:50/100m (comfortable)
  - #3-4: 2:45/100m (steady)
  - #5-6: 2:40/100m (moderate-hard)
  - #7-8: 2:35/100m (threshold)
- **Cooldown:** 200m easy

### Format 3: Mixed Distance Threshold
- **Total Distance:** 1500m
- **Warmup:** 300m progressive
- **Main Set:**
  - 3x200m @ 2:40/100m, 2:30 rest
  - 2min recovery
  - 4x100m @ 2:35/100m, 2:00 rest
  - 2min recovery
  - 6x50m @ 2:30/100m, 1:00 rest
- **Cooldown:** 200m easy

## Execution Guidelines
- **Pace Range:** 2:35-2:45/100m (sustainable hard)
- **Effort:** RPE 7-8/10 (comfortably hard)
- **Stroke Rate:** Controlled, not rushed
- **Breathing:** Elevated but rhythmic
- **Feel:** Could continue but it's challenging

**Key Focus:**
- **Smooth power:** Strong strokes without straining
- **Rhythm:** Consistent stroke timing
- **Efficiency:** Minimize drag, maximize glide
- **Breathing:** Bilateral pattern when possible
- **Mental focus:** Stay present, don't drift

## Success Criteria
- Hold target pace range consistently across set
- Technique stays solid throughout
- Complete all prescribed intervals
- Breathing controlled and rhythmic
- Feel tired but not destroyed

## Pacing Strategy
### Even Pace Approach
- Start at target pace from first interval
- Maintain same pace throughout
- Fight against any slowing
- Last intervals should feel hardest

### Negative Split Approach
- Start slightly easier (2:45/100m)
- Build pace gradually
- Finish at threshold (2:35-2:40/100m)
- Last intervals fastest

**Recommended:** Even pace for most sessions, negative split occasionally

## Rest Intervals
- **Short rest (1:00-1:30):** Minimal recovery, high intensity
- **Standard rest (2:00-2:15):** Balanced approach
- **Long rest (2:30-3:00):** Quality focus

Use rest to:
- Check form mentally
- Control breathing
- Prepare for next interval
- Don't rush - use full rest period

## Technique at Threshold
Maintain despite effort:
- **High elbow:** Don't let elbow drop when tired
- **Hip rotation:** Engaged core, body roll
- **Streamline:** Tight body position
- **Catch timing:** Don't rush the catch
- **Finish:** Complete stroke to hips

## Breathing Pattern
- **Bilateral (every 3):** Preferred for balance and form
- **Every 2:** Acceptable if bilateral causes breathlessness
- **Mixed:** Every 3 on easy portions, every 2 when pushing

Rhythm is more important than strict pattern

## Pool Strategy (50m)
- **First 25m:** Controlled, establish rhythm
- **Second 25m:** Maintain or slightly build pace
- **Turns:** Efficient, gain momentum
- **Push-off:** Strong, streamlined

## Progression Through Training
- **Early build:** Shorter intervals (5x100m, 3x200m)
- **Mid build:** Standard formats (6x100m, 4x200m)
- **Race prep:** Longer intervals (3x300m, 2x400m)

## Recovery Needs
- **Day before:** Easy swim recommended
- **Day after:** Easy technique or rest
- **Weekly frequency:** 1x per week
- **Rest week:** Reduce volume (3x100m) or skip

## Common Mistakes
- **Too fast:** Pushing into speed/VO2 range (>2:35/100m)
- **Too easy:** Cruising in endurance zone (<2:45/100m)
- **Fading:** Starting too aggressive and slowing badly
- **Form breakdown:** Sacrificing technique for pace
- **Rushed rest:** Not taking full recovery between intervals

## Race Relevance
This pace range represents:
- **Slightly faster than Ironman race pace** (~10-15 sec/100m faster)
- **Sustainable for 60+ minutes** when fit
- **Good indicator** of race readiness
- **Mental preparation** for sustained effort

If you can hold 2:40/100m for 5x100m, you can race at 2:50-2:55/100m for 3800m

## Notes
- These sessions build confidence for race pacing
- Focus on smooth power, not forced speed
- Breathing should be controlled, not desperate
- Perfect practice for race day mental approach
- 50m pool intervals transfer well to open water
- Actual format specified in weekly schedule
- If struggling, reduce volume rather than compromising technique
