# Easy Run with Strides

## Description
Combination workout pairing aerobic base building with neuromuscular activation. Consists of an easy conversational run followed by 4-8 short speed bursts (strides). This format maintains running economy and fast-twitch recruitment without compromising the easy aerobic nature of the session.

## Standard Format
### Part 1: Easy Aerobic Run
- **Duration:** 30-65min (varies by prescription)
- **Heart Rate:** Z2-Low Z3 (125-145 bpm)
- **Pace:** 6:15-6:45/km (conversational)
- **Effort:** Easy, can talk in full sentences

### Part 2: Strides
- **Reps:** 4-8 x 15-20 seconds
- **Effort:** 90-95% max speed (controlled fast)
- **Recovery:** 60-90 seconds walk/jog between
- **Duration:** ~10min total including recovery

## Execution Guidelines

### Easy Run Portion
- Run at comfortable conversational pace
- Stay relaxed and maintain good form
- Use this as aerobic base building
- Don't worry about speed

### Transition to Strides
- After completing easy portion, find suitable surface
- Take 1-2 minutes to prepare mentally
- Stay loose and ready
- Don't rush into strides

### Strides Execution
- Gradual acceleration over first 5-10m
- Fast but controlled (NOT all-out sprints)
- Focus on quick turnover and relaxed form
- Walk/jog recovery until ready for next rep
- See [[workouts/run/strides|Strides workout]] for full details

## Success Criteria
- Easy run stays truly easy (Z2-Low Z3)
- Strides feel fast but controlled
- Quick recovery between strides
- No excessive fatigue from session
- Feel energized, not depleted

## Common Variations
- **Short format:** 35min easy + 6x15sec strides (total ~45min)
- **Standard format:** 50min easy + 6x20sec strides (total ~60min)
- **Extended format:** 65min easy + 8x20sec strides (total ~75min)

## Surface Selection
### Easy Run
- Any safe running surface
- Roads, paths, trails all acceptable

### Strides
- Flat, smooth surface preferred
- Grass, track, or smooth path ideal
- 100-150m straight section needed

## Integration with Training
- **Frequency:** 1-2x per week during build phases
- **Placement:** Mid-week or after rest day
- **Day after:** Easy run or cross-training
- **Recovery weeks:** Reduce to 4x15sec strides

## Common Mistakes
- Running easy portion too hard (anticipating strides)
- Doing strides as all-out sprints
- Insufficient recovery between strides
- Forcing the strides when feeling fatigued
- Skipping easy run to "save energy" for strides

## Notes
- Easy run quality is primary goal - strides are bonus
- If feeling tired, skip strides and keep run easy
- Perfect for maintaining speed during base building
- Low injury risk when executed properly
- Actual duration specified in weekly schedule
- Can move strides to different location if needed
