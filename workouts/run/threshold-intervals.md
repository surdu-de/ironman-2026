# Threshold Intervals

## Description
Structured interval workout at or near lactate threshold. These sessions improve your ability to sustain hard efforts and are critical for race pacing. Various formats used throughout training plan.

## Common Formats

### Format 1: 5x4min @ Z4
- **Total Duration:** 60min
- **Warmup:** 10min easy (Z1-Z2)
- **Main Set:** 5x4min @ Z4 threshold
- **Recovery:** 3min jog between intervals (Z1)
- **Cooldown:** 10min easy

### Format 2: 3x8min @ Z4
- **Total Duration:** 60min
- **Warmup:** 10min easy with gradual build
- **Main Set:** 3x8min @ Z4 threshold
- **Recovery:** 3min jog between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 10min easy

### Format 3: 2x12min @ Z4
- **Total Duration:** 60min
- **Warmup:** 15min easy
- **Main Set:** 2x12min @ Z4 threshold
- **Recovery:** 5min jog between intervals
- **Cooldown:** 10min easy

## Execution Guidelines
- **Heart Rate:** Z4 (145-165 bpm / 91-95% HRmax)
- **Pace:** ~20-30 sec/km faster than marathon pace (5:30-6:00/km)
- **Effort:** RPE 8/10 - "comfortably hard"
- **Breathing:** Can speak 2-3 word phrases only
- **Cadence:** 85-90 spm (natural, not forced)

**Key Points:**
- Start intervals conservatively - they should feel manageable early
- Each interval should feel similar in effort (even if pace drifts slightly)
- Recovery jogs should be truly easy to allow proper recovery
- Last interval should be hardest but still controlled

## Success Criteria
- Complete all prescribed intervals at target pace/HR
- Maintain form throughout (no breakdown)
- Recovery jogs truly easy, not rushed
- Feel tired but accomplished, not destroyed
- Can train normally the next day (easy session)

## Pacing Strategy
- **First interval:** Should feel like 7/10 effort
- **Middle intervals:** 8/10 effort, rhythm established
- **Final interval:** 8-9/10 effort, holding on

**Common mistake:** Starting too hard on first interval, fading on later ones

## Course Requirements
- **Surface:** Flat road or track preferred
- **Terrain:** Minimal elevation change
- **Safety:** Well-lit if evening, low traffic
- **Markers:** Ability to measure intervals (GPS watch/track)

## Progression Through Training
- **Early build:** Shorter intervals, more recovery (5x4min)
- **Mid build:** Longer intervals (3x8min, 4x6min)
- **Race prep:** Very long intervals or tempo runs (2x12min, 20-30min continuous)

## Recovery Needs
- **Day before:** Easy run or rest
- **Day after:** Easy run or cross-training
- **Weekly frequency:** Maximum 1x per week
- **Rest week:** Skip or do very light version

## Notes
- This is a KEY workout - don't skip or compromise
- Weather impacts performance - adjust expectations for heat/wind
- Track version works well (precise pacing, flat)
- Actual interval format specified in weekly schedule
- Mental toughness builder - embrace the discomfort
