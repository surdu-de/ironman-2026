# Strides

## Description
Short bursts of fast running (typically 15-20 seconds) designed to activate fast-twitch muscle fibers, improve running economy, and maintain neuromuscular fitness without adding significant fatigue. These are NOT all-out sprints.

## Standard Format
- **Reps:** 4-8 x 15-20 seconds
- **Effort:** 90-95% max speed (controlled fast)
- **Recovery:** 60-90 seconds walk/jog between
- **Distance:** ~80-100m per stride
- **Total Time:** 10-20 minutes including recovery

## Execution Guidelines
- **Effort:** Fast but controlled - NOT an all-out sprint
- **Form:** Focus on relaxed, powerful running
- **Cadence:** Quick turnover (90-95 spm)
- **Breathing:** Natural, not gasping
- **Build-up:** Gradual acceleration over first 5-10m
- **Float:** Maintain speed without straining

**Key Characteristics:**
- Smooth acceleration (not explosive start)
- Relaxed upper body
- Strong arm drive
- Quick leg turnover
- Controlled deceleration

## When to Include
### As Part of Easy Run
- After 30-40min of easy running
- When feeling fresh and warmed up
- Weekly maintenance (1-2x per week)

### Pre-Race
- 2-3 days before race
- 3-4 strides of 15sec
- Activates speed without fatigue

### Recovery from Hard Training
- Helps maintain turnover during recovery weeks
- Low volume (4x15sec)
- Very easy between reps

## Success Criteria
- Feel fast but controlled
- Form stays relaxed throughout
- Quick recovery between reps (HR drops quickly)
- No tightness or strain
- Feel energized, not fatigued

## Surface Selection
- **Preferred:** Flat grass, track, or smooth path
- **Avoid:** Uneven terrain, steep grades, hard concrete
- **Safety:** Clear, straight section 100-150m long

## Common Mistakes
- **Too fast:** Going all-out sprint speed
- **Too long:** Exceeding 20-25 seconds
- **Insufficient recovery:** Rushing between reps
- **Poor warm-up:** Not ready before strides
- **Forced cadence:** Overstriding or forcing turnover

## Variations
### Short & Fast (4-6 x 15sec)
- Higher turnover focus
- Very quick recovery
- Minimal fatigue

### Longer Build (6-8 x 20sec)
- More sustained speed
- Running economy focus
- Standard recovery

### Hill Strides (4-6 x 10-12sec uphill)
- Power development
- Different muscle activation
- Reduced impact stress

## Integration with Training
- **Easy days:** Add after easy runs when fresh
- **Hard days:** Skip or do very minimal
- **Recovery weeks:** Maintain but reduce volume (4x15sec)
- **Taper:** Keep short (3-4x15sec) for speed maintenance

## Notes
- These should feel good, not hard
- Quality of form matters more than speed achieved
- Can be done year-round without injury risk
- Perfect for maintaining top-end speed during base building
- Listen to body - skip if feeling fatigued or tight
