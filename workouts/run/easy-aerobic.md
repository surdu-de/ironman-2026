# Easy Aerobic Run

## Description
A conversational pace aerobic run focused on building aerobic base without excessive fatigue. Should feel comfortable throughout, with the ability to hold a conversation. Duration varies based on training phase and weekly schedule.

## Execution
- **Duration Range:** 40-75 minutes (prescribed in weekly schedule)
- **Distance Range:** ~6-12km (depending on duration)
- **Heart Rate:** Z2-Low Z3 (125-145 bpm)
- **Pace:** 6:15-6:45/km (conversational)
- **Effort:** Should be able to talk in full sentences

**Structure:**
- Continuous steady effort
- No warmup/cooldown needed (self-regulated easy pace)
- Focus on form and rhythm

## Success Criteria
- Heart rate stays in Z2-Low Z3 zone (125-145 bpm)
- Can maintain conversation throughout
- Feel fresh and energized after completion
- No excessive fatigue on following day

## Duration Guidelines
- **40-45min:** Recovery/easy days between hard sessions
- **50-60min:** Standard aerobic maintenance
- **65-75min:** Extended aerobic base building

## Common Variations
- **Weather:** Can be done on treadmill if needed (increase incline by 1-2%)
- **Course:** Flat routes preferred for steady pacing
- **Recovery weeks:** Use shorter durations (40-50min)

## Notes
- This is a foundational workout repeated throughout the training plan
- Focus on consistency over speed
- Listen to your body - stay in Z2-Low Z3 even if pace slows
- Actual duration specified in weekly schedule
