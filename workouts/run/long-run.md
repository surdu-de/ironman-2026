# Long Run

## Description
Weekend long run focused on building endurance capacity and mental toughness. These runs should feel sustainable but challenging, practicing race-day pacing and nutrition strategies. Duration varies based on training phase.

## Execution
- **Duration Range:** 75-120 minutes (prescribed in weekly schedule)
- **Distance Range:** ~11-18km (depending on duration)
- **Heart Rate:** Low Z3 (133-145 bpm)
- **Pace:** 6:15-6:45/km (steady, sustainable)
- **Effort:** Comfortably hard, can speak short sentences

**Structure:**
- Continuous steady effort throughout
- Maintain consistent pace and heart rate
- Practice race nutrition (see below)
- Focus on mental engagement

## Nutrition Practice
- **Hydration:** Drink every 15-20min
- **Fuel:** 30-60g carbs/hour for runs >90min
- **Products:** Practice with race-day nutrition (gels, sports drink)
- **Timing:** Test different intake schedules

## Success Criteria
- Heart rate stays in Low Z3 zone (133-145 bpm)
- Maintain consistent pace throughout
- Finish feeling tired but not destroyed
- Successfully execute nutrition plan
- Ready to train normally within 1-2 days

## Duration Progression
- **Base Phase (Weeks 1-12):** 75-90min
- **Build Phase (Weeks 13-20):** 90-105min
- **Peak Phase (Weeks 21-28):** 105-120min
- **Taper (Weeks 29-30):** 60-75min

## Course Selection
- **Terrain:** Varied terrain similar to race course
- **Surface:** Mix of roads and paths
- **Elevation:** Include some hills for specificity
- **Route:** Hamburg race course sections when possible

## Common Challenges
- **Starting too fast:** Use first 15min as gradual warmup
- **Fading pace:** Focus on even effort, not even pace
- **Mental fatigue:** Break run into segments, use visualization
- **Nutrition issues:** Test products during training, not race day

## Notes
- This is the key weekly endurance-building session
- Schedule on Saturday or Sunday when time permits
- Consider morning start to simulate race conditions
- Actual duration specified in weekly schedule
- Plan route with water/fuel access points
