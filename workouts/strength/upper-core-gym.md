## Scheduling Considerations

### Tuesday Morning (Gym Day)
- After 7:30 school drop-off
- 60min session (arrive 8:00, done 9:00)
- Shower at gym
- Ready for 10:00 standup

### Thursday Morning (Gym Day)
- Same timing as Tuesday
- Complements Thursday evening swim
- Upper body won't interfere with swim

## Integration with Training

### Good Combination Days
- **Day before:** Rest or easy swim
- **Day after:** Run (legs fresh) or easy bike
- **Same day:** Swim in evening (4-6 hours later)

### Avoid
- Day after hard run or bike workout
- Day before long run
- When feeling fatigued or overtrained

## Progression Guidelines

### Weeks 1-4 (Base Building)
- Focus on form and consistency
- Moderate weights, full reps
- Establish baseline

### Weeks 5-12 (Build)
- Increase weight by 5-10%
- Add reps or sets
- Maintain form quality

### Weeks 13-24 (Peak)
- Maintain strength gains
- Focus on power endurance
- Keep sessions efficient

### Weeks 25-30 (Taper)
- Reduce volume (2 sets)
- Maintain intensity
- Recovery priority

## Common Mistakes
- **Too heavy:** Sacrificing form for weight
- **Too much volume:** Over 70min defeats recovery purpose
- **Skipping core:** Core is critical for all three sports
- **Poor scheduling:** Doing day before hard run/bike
- **No warmup:** Going straight to heavy lifting

## Success Criteria
- Complete session in 50-70min
- Maintain good form throughout
- Feel worked but not destroyed
- Upper body/core fatigued, legs fresh
- Ready for evening training if scheduled

## Notes
- This session prioritizes upper body while sparing legs
- Perfect for Tuesday/Thursday when legs need recovery
- Supports swim strength and power
- Core work benefits all three sports
- Can be done same day as swim (AM strength, PM swim)
- Listen to body - reduce volume if overly fatigued
- Actual exercises and sets specified in weekly schedule
