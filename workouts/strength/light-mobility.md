# Light Mobility

## Description
Gentle movement session focused on maintaining mobility, promoting recovery, and preventing injury. This is NOT a workout - it's active recovery with light strength maintenance. The goal is to feel better after than before, with zero fatigue added.

## Session Structure
**Total Duration:** 30-50 minutes

1. **Dynamic Warmup:** 10min gentle movement
2. **Mobility Work:** 15-25min focused stretching
3. **Core Maintenance:** 10-15min very light core
4. **Relaxation:** 5min breathing and stillness

## Dynamic Warmup (10min)
**Goal:** Gentle activation, increase blood flow, assess how body feels

- Walking in place: 2min
- Arm circles: 1min (slow and controlled)
- Leg swings: 1min (front/back, side/side)
- Hip circles: 1min each direction
- Cat-cow stretches: 2min (slow and mindful)
- Gentle torso twists: 2min

- Promote adaptation and healing

### Day After Very Hard Training
- Long run or bike the day before
- Hard interval session
- Feeling particularly fatigued

### Injury Prevention Phase
- Noticing niggles or tightness
- High training load period
- Mental break from hard training

## Exercise Modifications

### If Very Fatigued
- Skip core maintenance entirely
- Focus only on stretching and breathing
- Shorten to 30min
- More time in restorative poses

### If Feeling Good
- Add yoga flow sequences
- Include more dynamic mobility
- Extend to 50min
- But still keep intensity very low!

## Equipment Options

### Minimal (Home)
- Yoga mat or towel
- Pillow or cushion
- Wall for support
- That's it!

### Nice to Have

- Bolster or pillows

## Location Flexibility

### At Home
- Living room or bedroom

- Use gym mats/equipment

## Integration with Training Schedule

### Tuesday (Recovery Week)

- Focus on hip flexors (cycling/running)

### Any Evening
- After dinner, before bed
- Promotes better sleep
- Relaxation focus
- Gentle wind-down

## Common Mistakes (AVOID!)
- **Pushing too hard:** This isn't flexibility training, it's recovery
- **Treating like workout:** No sweat, no breathlessness
- **Skipping when tired:** This is MOST valuable when tired
- **Adding exercises:** Don't sneak in "just a few" strength moves
- **Rushing:** Slow, mindful, present

## Signs You're Doing It Right
- Feel more relaxed than when started
- No sweating or heavy breathing
- Mind feels calm
- Body feels loose and mobile
- Could fall asleep after (good sign!)
- Zero fatigue added

## Signs You're Going Too Hard
- Breathing elevated
- Sweating
- Muscles burning
- Feeling "worked"
- More tired after than before

If any of these happen, EASE OFF!

## Success Criteria
- Complete session feeling refreshed
- Improved range of motion
- Mental clarity increased
- Zero training stress added
- Feel ready for next day's training
- Body awareness improved

## Notes
- This is valuable training, not "wasted time"
- Mobility work prevents injuries
- Recovery is when adaptation happens
- Can be done more than 1x per week if desired
- Perfect for rest days or recovery weeks
- Listen to body - if area is tight, spend more time there
- Can combine with meditation or podcast listening
- Low ego activity - embrace the gentleness
