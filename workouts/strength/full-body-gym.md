# Full Body Gym Session

## Description
Comprehensive strength training session targeting all major muscle groups with emphasis on functional movements for triathlon. Builds strength foundation while preventing common overuse injuries.

## Execution
- **Duration:** 60 minutes
- **Location:** Gym
- **Intensity:** Moderate weight, focus on form

**Structure:**

### Warmup (10min)
- 5min light cardio (rowing machine, bike, or dynamic stretching)
- Dynamic stretches: leg swings, arm circles, torso rotations
- Activation: glute bridges, plank holds

### Lower Body (20min)
**Squats: 3x12**
- Barbell back squat or goblet squat
- Weight: Moderate (should feel challenging on last 2 reps)
- Focus: Full depth, knees tracking over toes, upright torso
- Rest: 90s between sets

**Deadlifts: 3x8**
- Conventional or Romanian deadlift
- Weight: Moderate-heavy
- Focus: Flat back, hip hinge, full extension
- Rest: 2min between sets

**Lunges: 3x10 each leg**
- Walking lunges or stationary
- Bodyweight or holding dumbbells
- Focus: Knee tracking, balance, control
- Rest: 60s between sets

### Upper Body (15min)
**Pull-ups/Rows: 3x8**
- Pull-ups (or assisted) OR bent-over rows
- Focus: Scapular retraction, controlled movement
- Rest: 90s between sets

**Push-ups: 3x10**
- Standard or modified (knees)
- Focus: Plank position, full range of motion
- Rest: 60s between sets

### Core (15min)
**Circuit (3 rounds):**
1. Plank holds: 60s
2. Side plank: 30s each side
3. Dead bugs: 20 reps
4. Russian twists: 30 reps
5. Glute bridges: 20 reps

Rest: 60s between rounds

## Success Criteria
- Complete all prescribed sets and reps
- Maintain proper form throughout
- Feel muscle fatigue but not joint pain
- No impact on next day's training quality

## Common Variations
**Recovery Week:**
- Reduce to 2 sets per exercise
- Lighter weight, focus on form
- Add more mobility work

**Build Week:**
- Add 1 set to main lifts
- Increase weight by 5-10%
- Add plyometric exercises (box jumps, medicine ball throws)

**Time-Constrained:**
- Superset opposing muscle groups
- Reduce rest periods to 45-60s
- Core work can be done at home later

## Exercise Substitutions
**If equipment unavailable:**
- Squats → Goblet squats, split squats
- Deadlifts → Single-leg RDLs, good mornings
- Pull-ups → TRX rows, resistance band rows
- Gym → Home bodyweight workout

## Progression Guidelines
**Weeks 1-4:** Establish baseline, perfect form
**Weeks 5-8:** Increase weight by 5-10%
**Weeks 9-12:** Add 1 rep per set OR add 1 set
**Weeks 13+:** Transition to maintenance mode (lighter, higher rep)

## Notes
- Strength training supports injury prevention and power development
- Quality over quantity - form is paramount
- Don't go to failure - leave 1-2 reps in reserve
- This is supplementary to swim/bike/run - don't let it compromise recovery
