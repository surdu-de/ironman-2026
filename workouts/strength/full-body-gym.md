# Full Body Gym Session

## Description
Comprehensive gym-based strength training session utilizing machines and free weights to target all major muscle groups. Focused on exercises that require gym equipment (leg press, bench press, cable machines) rather than bodyweight movements. Builds strength foundation while preventing common overuse injuries in triathlon training.

## Execution
- **Duration:** 65-70 minutes
- **Location:** Gym (requires access to machines and free weights)
- **Intensity:** Moderate weight, focus on form

**Structure:**

### Warmup (10min)
- 5min light cardio on rowing machine or stationary bike
- Dynamic stretches: leg swings, arm circles, torso rotations
- Activation: Leg press warmup set (light weight), cable shoulder rotations

### Lower Body (20min)
**Leg Press: 3x12**
- Machine leg press (45-degree or horizontal)
- Weight: Moderate-heavy (challenging on last 2 reps)
- Focus: Full range of motion, feet shoulder-width, controlled descent
- Rest: 90s between sets

**Deadlifts: 3x8**
- Conventional or Romanian deadlift with barbell
- Weight: Moderate-heavy
- Focus: Flat back, hip hinge, full extension
- Rest: 2min between sets

**Leg Curl Machine: 3x12**
- Lying or seated leg curl
- Weight: Moderate
- Focus: Hamstring isolation, controlled movement, full contraction
- Rest: 60s between sets

**Leg Extension Machine: 3x12**
- Seated leg extension
- Weight: Moderate
- Focus: Quadriceps isolation, full extension without locking knees
- Rest: 60s between sets

### Upper Body (20min)
**Bench Press: 3x10**
- Barbell or dumbbell bench press
- Weight: Moderate (challenging on last 2 reps)
- Focus: Full range of motion, controlled descent, chest engagement
- Rest: 2min between sets

**Lat Pulldown or Cable Rows: 3x10**
- Wide grip lat pulldown OR seated cable rows
- Weight: Moderate
- Focus: Scapular retraction, controlled movement, full range
- Rest: 90s between sets

**Shoulder Press Machine: 3x10**
- Seated shoulder press machine
- Weight: Moderate
- Focus: Full extension, controlled movement, no arching back
- Rest: 90s between sets

**Cable Flys or Tricep Pushdowns: 3x12**
- Cable chest flys OR cable tricep rope pushdowns
- Weight: Light-moderate
- Focus: Isolation, constant tension, controlled tempo
- Rest: 60s between sets

### Core (15min)
**Circuit (3 rounds):**
1. Cable wood chops: 15 reps each side
2. Cable crunches (rope attachment): 20 reps
3. Hanging knee raises or captain's chair: 12 reps
4. Russian twists with medicine ball: 30 reps
5. Cable pull-throughs (glutes): 15 reps

Rest: 60s between rounds

**Alternative if cable machines unavailable:**
- Replace cable exercises with bodyweight: planks, side planks, dead bugs

## Success Criteria
- Complete all prescribed sets and reps
- Maintain proper form throughout
- Feel muscle fatigue but not joint pain
- No impact on next day's training quality

## Common Variations
**Recovery Week:**
- Reduce to 2 sets per exercise
- Lighter weight (50-60% of normal), focus on form
- Replace leg curl/extension with mobility work
- Reduce core to bodyweight exercises

**Build Week:**
- Add 1 set to main lifts (leg press, bench press, deadlifts)
- Increase weight by 5-10%
- Add 4th exercise to lower body: calf raises on machine
- Add bicep curls (cable or dumbbell): 3x12

**Time-Constrained (45-50min):**
- Superset opposing muscle groups (leg press + cable rows)
- Reduce rest periods to 45-60s
- Skip isolation exercises (leg curl/extension, cable flys)
- Core work can be done at home later

## Exercise Substitutions
**If specific machines unavailable:**
- Leg Press → Barbell squats, goblet squats, hack squat machine
- Leg Curl → Romanian deadlifts, glute-ham raises
- Leg Extension → Bulgarian split squats, step-ups with weight
- Bench Press → Dumbbell press, chest press machine
- Lat Pulldown → Pull-ups, assisted pull-up machine
- Cable Rows → Barbell bent-over rows, T-bar rows
- Shoulder Press Machine → Dumbbell shoulder press, barbell overhead press
- Cable exercises → Resistance band alternatives

**If no gym access:**
- Use home bodyweight workout instead (separate workout file)

## Progression Guidelines
**Weeks 1-4:** Establish baseline, perfect form
**Weeks 5-8:** Increase weight by 5-10%
**Weeks 9-12:** Add 1 rep per set OR add 1 set
**Weeks 13+:** Transition to maintenance mode (lighter, higher rep)

## Notes
- **Gym equipment focus:** This workout maximizes use of machines and equipment that aren't available at home (leg press, bench press, cable machines)
- Strength training supports injury prevention and power development for triathlon
- Quality over quantity - form is paramount, especially on machines
- Don't go to failure - leave 1-2 reps in reserve
- This is supplementary to swim/bike/run - don't let it compromise recovery
- **Machine advantages:** More stable, easier to isolate muscles, safer for heavy loads
- Track weights used for each exercise to ensure progressive overload
