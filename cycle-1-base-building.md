## Testing Protocols - Week 4

### CSS (Critical Swim Speed) Test - Thursday Evening
**Purpose:** Establish swim training zones

1. 400m warm-up
2. **400m time trial** - record time in seconds (T400)
3. 10 minutes rest (easy swimming or treading water)
4. **200m time trial** - record time in seconds (T200)
5. 200m cool-down

**CSS Calculation:**
```
CSS (seconds per 100m) = (T400 - T200) / 2
CSS (min:sec per 100m) = Convert to minutes:seconds format
```

**Example:** T400 = 600s (10:00), T200 = 280s (4:40)
CSS = (600 - 280) / 2 = 160s = 2:40/100m

---

### FTP Test (20-minute protocol) - Friday Evening
**Purpose:** Establish bike power training zones

1. 20 min progressive warm-up (gradually increase intensity)
2. 5 min at current estimated FTP (195W)
3. 5 min easy recovery spinning
4. **20 min ALL-OUT effort** - maintain highest sustainable power
   - Start conservatively, build if feeling strong
   - Should feel very hard but sustainable for 20min
   - Record average power
5. 10 min cool-down

**FTP Calculation:**
```
FTP = 95% of 20-minute average power
```

**Example:** 20min avg power = 205W
New FTP = 205 × 0.95 = 195W

---

### Run Threshold Test (30-minute protocol) - Saturday Morning
**Purpose:** Establish run pace and heart rate zones

1. 15 min warm-up Z1-Z2 (easy jogging)
2. **30 min TIME TRIAL** - run as fast as you can sustain for 30 minutes
   - Even pacing is critical
   - Should feel hard but controlled
   - Record average pace (min/km)
   - Record average heart rate (bpm)
3. 10 min cool-down (easy jogging/walking)

**Results:**
```
Threshold Pace = Average pace of 30-min effort
Threshold HR = Average HR of 30-min effort
```

---

### Post-Test Actions

After completing all three tests:

1. **Calculate new training zones:**
   - Update bike zones based on new FTP
   - Update run zones based on threshold pace and HR
   - Update swim zones based on CSS

2. **Record baseline data:**
   - Date: December 4-6, 2025
   - FTP: ___ W (previous: 195W)
   - CSS: ___ min/100m (previous: 2:33/100m)
   - Run Threshold Pace: ___ min/km
   - Run Threshold HR: ___ bpm

3. **Compare to baseline:**
   - Note improvements or changes
   - Adjust Cycle 2 training intensities accordingly

4. **Recovery:**
   - Rest well Sunday
   - Celebrate completing Cycle 1!
   - Prepare mentally for Cycle 2

## Cycle 1 Key Points

### Nutrition Guidelines

**Build Weeks (Weeks 1-3):**
- Carbs: 5-7g/kg body weight (450-630g at 90kg)
- Protein: 1.6-2.0g/kg (144-180g at 90kg)
- Hydration: 500-750ml/hour with electrolytes during training

**Recovery Week (Week 4):**
- Carbs: 4-5g/kg (360-450g at 90kg)
- Protein: 1.8-2.0g/kg (162-180g at 90kg)

**During Long Sessions:**
- Bike >90min: 60-70g carbs/hour
- Run >60min: 30-40g carbs/hour
- Practice race-day nutrition on Saturday long rides

---

### Recovery Priorities

- **Sleep:** 7-9 hours per night (critical for adaptation)
- **HRV Monitoring:** Track daily to assess recovery status
- **Resting Heart Rate:** Monitor each morning (elevated = need more recovery)
- **Active Recovery:** Easy spinning, walking, stretching on rest days
- **Nutrition Timing:** Protein + carbs within 30min post-workout

---

### Warning Signs - Reduce Volume If You Notice:

- Persistent fatigue beyond normal training tiredness
- Elevated resting heart rate (>5 bpm above baseline)
- Decreased HRV (>10% below normal)
- Sleep disturbances or poor sleep quality
- Loss of motivation or mental burnout
- Increased susceptibility to illness
- Unusual muscle soreness lasting >48 hours

**Action:** If experiencing 2+ warning signs, reduce volume by 20% and prioritize recovery.

---

### Schedule Flexibility Tips

- **Weather:** Indoor trainer available for bike sessions
- **Time conflicts:** Prioritize long weekend sessions (Saturday bike, Sunday run)
- **Work demands:** Lunch workouts can be shortened to 45min if needed
- **Family emergencies:** Monday rest day can shift if needed
- **Fatigue:** Better to reduce intensity than skip sessions entirely

---

### Week-by-Week Focus

**Week 1:** Establish routine, get comfortable with schedule, focus on technique
**Week 2:** Increase volume, add some intensity (tempo efforts), maintain consistency
**Week 3:** Peak volume, practice race nutrition, mental toughness (brick workout)
**Week 4:** Recover, test, celebrate progress, prepare for Cycle 2

---

## Equipment Checklist

### Required:
- Bike with power meter (FTP testing and training)
- Heart rate monitor (run testing and training)
- Indoor bike trainer (weather backup, early morning sessions)
- Running shoes with <400km wear
- Swim gear (goggles, cap, suit)

### Recommended:
- Running watch with GPS (pace/distance tracking)
