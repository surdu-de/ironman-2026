## Cycle 1 Learnings

1. **Volume tolerance** is high - can extend sessions when feeling good
2. **Testing protocol:** Ramp test works well for FTP
3. **Garmin workouts:** Sprint-focused, not ideal for Ironman
4. **Technique focus:** High drill % in swim maintained
5. **Recovery:** Smart to prioritize recovery over volume when needed
