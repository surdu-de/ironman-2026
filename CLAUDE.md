This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal training planning repository for completing Ironman Hamburg on June 7, 2026. Andrei is ˚based in Hamburg, Germany, providing a home advantage for course familiarization.

## Training Structure

- **Duration:** 30 weeks (Nov 10, 2025 - Jun 7, 2026)
- **Periodization:** 3 weeks build + 1 week recovery (7 cycles + 2-week taper)
- **Weekly Constraints:**
  - Monday: Rest day (easy/technique swim allowed starting Week 5 in build weeks)
  - Thursday: Fixed swim session
  - Swim sessions should NOT be scheduled back-to-back days (need rest between swim sessions)
  - 50m pool available
  - **Weekend:** Flexible for long sessions

## Daily Schedule & Constraints

### Work Schedule
- **Work Hours:** 9:00-18:00 (flexible schedule, remote except Tue/Thu)
- **Onsite Days:** Tuesday and Thursday
- **Remote Days:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday (training flexibility)
- **Earliest Meeting:** 10:00 (standup)
- **Training Windows:** Morning (before 9:00), lunch break, evening (after 18:00)

### Family Commitments
- **School Drop-off:** 7:45 daily (daughter starts at 8:00)
- **School Pick-up:**
  - Monday: 18:30
  - Wednesday: 16:00
  - Thursday: 17:30
  - Other days: flexible

## Priority Focus

1. Bike performance (primary time improvement target)
2. Run & VO2 Max (secondary focus)
3. Swim technique (continuous refinement)

## Key Standards

- Use kilometers for all distances (athlete is in Germany)
- Keep project language in English
- Week numbering follows the 30-week plan


## Location Context

Training location is Hamburg, Germany - the same city as the race. This enables:
- Training on actual race course sections
- Adaptation to local weather patterns
- Mental preparation through course visualization

## Repository Setup

- **Obsidian Integration:** This project is symlinked to `/Users/razvan.surdu/Brain/40 projects/ironman-2026` for viewing all markdown files within the Obsidian vault
- All training plans, weekly schedules, and documentation are accessible through Obsidian for easy note-taking and cross-referencing

**Note:** The `-current` suffix indicates the active training cycle. Move this suffix to the next cycle file as training progresses.

## Training Intensity Rules

- **NEVER combine hard bike + hard run same day**
  - Hard bike = Threshold, VO2max, Tempo intervals, FTP tests
  - Hard run = Threshold, intervals, tempo runs
- **Allowed combinations:**
  - Easy bike + hard run
  - Hard bike + easy run
  - Easy bike + easy run
