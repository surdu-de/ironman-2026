This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal training planning repository for completing Ironman Hamburg on June 7, 2026. The athlete is based in Hamburg, Germany, providing a home advantage for course familiarization.

## Training Structure

- **Duration:** 30 weeks (Nov 10, 2025 - Jun 7, 2026)
- **Periodization:** 3 weeks build + 1 week recovery (7 cycles + 2-week taper)
- **Weekly Constraints:**
  - Monday: Rest day (mandatory)
  - Tuesday/Thursday: Gym access
  - Thursday: Fixed swim session
  - 50m pool available

## Priority Focus

1. Bike performance (primary time improvement target)
2. Run & VO2 Max (secondary focus)
3. Swim technique (continuous refinement)

## Key Standards

- Use kilometers for all distances (athlete is in Germany)
- Keep project language in English
- Week numbering follows the 30-week plan (currently Week 1)
- Testing weeks: 4, 12, 20, 28 (FTP, run threshold, CSS tests)

## Location Context

Training location is Hamburg, Germany - the same city as the race. This enables:
- Training on actual race course sections
- Adaptation to local weather patterns
- Mental preparation through course visualization
