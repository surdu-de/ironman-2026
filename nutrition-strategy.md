# Nutrition Strategy

## Training Nutrition

### Daily Macronutrient Targets

**Body Weight:** 90 kg

#### Carbohydrates
- **Moderate Training Days:** 5-7g/kg (450-630g)
- **High-Volume Days:** 7-10g/kg (630-900g)
- Focus on complex carbs (rice, pasta, oats, sweet potatoes)

#### Protein
- **Daily Target:** 1.6-2.0g/kg (144-180g)
- Distribute across meals (20-40g per meal)
- Post-workout: 20-30g within 30 minutes

#### Hydration
- Monitor urine color (aim for light yellow)
- Track weight changes (>2% loss indicates dehydration)
- Electrolytes on long sessions (>90 minutes)

### During Training

| Session Type | Duration | Carbs/Hour | Hydration/Hour | Notes |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------------|-------|
| **Bike** | <90 min | Not required | 500-750ml | Water only |
| **Bike** | >90 min | 60-90g | 500-750ml | Practice race nutrition |
| **Run** | <60 min | Not required | 400-600ml | Water only |
| **Run** | >60 min | 30-60g | 400-600ml | Gels or sports drink |
| **Swim** | Any | Not required | Post-session | Rehydrate after |

### Recovery Nutrition

**Post-Workout Window:** Within 30 minutes
- **Protein:** 20-30g (whey protein, Greek yogurt, eggs)
- **Carbs:** 1-1.5g/kg (90-135g) to replenish glycogen
- **Example:** Protein shake + banana + oats

## Race Day Nutrition Plan

### Pre-Race (3-4 hours before)
- **Meal:** High carb, low fiber, familiar foods
- **Example:** White bread toast with honey, banana, oatmeal
- **Hydration:** 500ml water with electrolytes
- **Avoid:** New foods, high fiber, high fat

### Swim (3.8 km, ~1h30-2h)
- **Nutrition:** None required
- **Hydration:** None during swim
- **Note:** Stay calm, conserve energy

### T1 (Swim-to-Bike Transition)
- Quick water rinse
- Prepare bottles on bike
- Optional: Small bite if feeling low

### Bike (180 km, ~6-7h)
- **Carbs:** 60-90g per hour
  - Start intake at 15-20 minutes
  - Use mix of gels, bars, and sports drink
- **Hydration:** 500-750ml per hour
  - Alternate between water and electrolyte drink
  - Adjust for temperature/humidity
- **Sodium:** 500-700mg per hour (electrolyte tabs)
- **Strategy:**
  - Set timer for every 15-20 minutes (nutrition reminder)
  - Front-load nutrition in first 3 hours
  - Slightly reduce in final hour before run

### T2 (Bike-to-Run Transition)
- Switch to run nutrition setup
- Optional: Quick gel if feeling depleted

### Run (42.2 km, ~4-5h)
- **Carbs:** 30-60g per hour
  - Gels work best (easier digestion)
  - Aid stations: sports drink, cola in final 10km
- **Hydration:** 400-600ml per hour
  - Balance between water and sports drink
  - Don't overdrink (hyponatremia risk)
- **Sodium:** 300-500mg per hour
- **Strategy:**
  - Walk through aid stations
  - Take gel with water (not sports drink)
  - Mental markers every 5km

## Nutrition Practice Schedule

### Build Weeks
- **Week 1-2:** Test products during training
- **Week 3:** Simulate race nutrition on long bike
- **All Long Sessions:** Practice intake timing

### Race-Specific Weeks (Cycles 5-7)
- Full dress rehearsals on long sessions
- Test race-morning breakfast routine
- Practice transitions with nutrition

---

## Product Recommendations

### Carbohydrate Sources
- **Gels:** SiS, Maurten, GU (choose based on gut tolerance)
- **Bars:** Clif, PowerBar (first half of bike only)
- **Drink Mix:** Maurten 320, SiS Go Electrolyte
- **Solid:** Rice cakes, mini bananas (early bike)

### Electrolytes
- **Tablets:** Nuun, SiS Hydro
- **Capsules:** SaltStick (backup for hot conditions)

### Recovery
- **Protein:** Whey isolate, casein (bedtime)
- **Carbs:** Maltodextrin, dextrose (immediate post-workout)

## Key Principles

1. **Nothing New on Race Day** - Test everything in training
2. **Start Early** - Begin nutrition at 15-20 minutes, not when hungry
3. **Consistency** - Set timers, don't rely on feeling
4. **Adapt** - Adjust for temperature, effort, gut tolerance
5. **Practice** - Rehearse race nutrition on every long session
