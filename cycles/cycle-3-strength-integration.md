## Weekly Progression

| Week | Phase | Planned | Actual | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| 9 | Build + Test | 10h30 | **8h35** | FTP 225W, snow storm disruption |
| 10 | Build 2 | 12h35 | **15h40** | +25% overreach |
| 11 | Build 3 (Peak) | 14h05 | **~10h40** | Fatigue hit Tuesday, adapted |
| 12 | Recovery | 6h40 | ~2h25 | True recovery, travel Fri-Sun |

## Key Achievements

- **FTP test:** 225W (+5W from 220W baseline)
- **Long bike peak:** 4h03 / 125.6km (Week 11 Sunday)
- **Long run peak:** 2h30 / 24.7km (Week 11)
- **Mental toughness:** 2h run in heavy snow (Week 9)
- **Adaptation:** Recovered from Tuesday failure (Week 11)

## Challenges & Learnings

### Week 10 Overreach
- Planned: 12h35 | Actual: **15h40** (+25%)
- Extended long bike to 3h52 / 121km
- Extended long run to 2h20 / 23km
- **Result:** Week 11 started fatigued

### Week 11 Fatigue
- Tuesday bike failed after 24min (couldn't complete 2nd set)
- Needed Monday rest (planned was swim)
- Used Garmin recommendations instead of structured plan
- Still completed weekend long sessions

### Garmin Data Insights
- **Acute Training Load:** At ceiling (~1750-1800)
- **Low Aerobic:** Overloaded (too much Z2)
- **Anaerobic:** Deficit (need more short power work)
- **HRV:** Balanced (recovered)

---

## Key Decisions for Future Cycles

1. **Weekly cap: 12h** (15h+ causes next-week fatigue)
2. **2 swims/week max** (life constraint)
3. **No extensions** when feeling good - bank energy
4. **Add anaerobic work** to address deficit
5. **Use Garmin** for daily readiness, not rigid plan
6. **Sunday = long bike, Saturday = long run**

## Testing (Week 12)

| Test | Day | Result |
|------|-----|--------|
| Run Threshold | Wed Jan 28 | Pending |
| FTP | - | Skipped (recent test) |
| CSS | - | Skipped (swim is lowest priority) |
