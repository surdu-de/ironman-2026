This first cycle establishes the foundation for the entire training block through progressive volume increase (10h → 13h → 15h) followed by recovery and testing.

### Goals
- Build aerobic base across all three disciplines
- Establish consistent training habits within daily schedule constraints
- Refine technique (especially swimming)
- Test and establish updated training zones for Cycle 2

**Progress:** ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ (0/4 weeks completed)

### Weekly Volume Progression
- **Week 1:** ~10h45 (9 sessions) - Establish routine, technique work
- **Week 2:** ~13h (10 sessions) - Volume increase, aerobic development
- **Week 3:** ~14h45 (11 sessions) - Peak volume, intensity introduction
- **Week 4:** ~6-8h (7 sessions) - Recovery + Testing

### Key Sessions
- **Saturdays:** Long bike rides (2h30 → 3h → 3h30) - practice nutrition
