# Cycle 1: Base Building

**Duration:** Weeks 1-4 (November 10 - December 7, 2025)
**Focus:** Aerobic endurance, technique refinement, establishing training routine

## Cycle Overview

This first cycle establishes the foundation for the entire training block through progressive volume increase (10h → 13h → 15h) followed by recovery and testing.

### Goals
- Build aerobic base across all three disciplines
- Establish consistent training habits within daily schedule constraints
- Refine technique (especially swimming)
- Test and establish updated training zones for Cycle 2

**Current Week:** [Week 3 - Build (Peak)](week-03.md) (Nov 24-30, 2025)
**Progress:** ✅ ⚠️ ⬜ ⬜ (2/4 weeks completed)

### Weekly Volume Progression
- **Week 1:** ~8h25 (7 sessions) - Establish routine, technique work
- **Week 2:** ~11h20 (10 sessions) - Volume increase, introduce threshold work
- **Week 3:** ~12h55 (11 sessions) - Peak volume with threshold work
- **Week 4:** ~6-8h (7 sessions) - Recovery + Testing

### Key Sessions
- **Saturdays:** Long bike rides (2h → 2h15 → 2h45) - practice nutrition
- **Sundays:** Long runs (75min → 80min) + Week 3 brick workout
- **Tuesday:** Threshold intensity sessions (Week 2-3: bike Z4, run Z4)
- **Thursday Evenings:** Fixed swim slot (20:00-21:00) with VO2max work (Week 2-3)
- **Tuesday/Thursday:** Gym strength sessions (maintain throughout cycle)

### Nutrition Focus
- **Build weeks:** 5-7g carbs/kg, 1.6-2.0g protein/kg
- **Recovery week:** 4-5g carbs/kg
- **Long rides:** Practice race nutrition (60-70g carbs/hour)

### Training Zones
**Current Baselines (Nov 10, 2025):**
- **Bike FTP:** 195W (2.17 W/kg)
- **Swim CSS:** 2:33/100m
- **Run:** HR-based zones (see [README](40-projects/ironman-2026/README.md#training-zones))

**Note:** All zones will be updated after Week 4 testing (Dec 4-6, 2025)
