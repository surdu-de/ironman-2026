## Week Summaries

### Week 9: Jan 5-11 (Build + Testing)
**Actual:** 8h35 vs 10h30 planned (82%)

**Testing:**
- FTP Ramp Test (Jan 6): **225W** (+5W from 220W baseline)
- Run/Swim tests: Postponed to Week 12 (snow storm + pool closed)

| Discipline | Sessions | Time | Distance |
|------------|----------|------|----------|
| Swim | 1 | 60min | 1,950m |
| Bike | 3 | 274min | 125.6km |
| Run | 3 | 181min | 28.7km |

**Key Sessions:**
- Long run in snow: 2h / 18.1km (149 HR - elevated due to conditions)
- Long bike with tempo blocks: 3h11 / 93km @ 141W
- Sweet Spot + HIIT bike: 60min, NP 191W

**Disruptions:** Wednesday snow storm + ice injury, Thursday pool closed. Smart adaptations maintained training.

### Week 10: Jan 12-18 (Build 2 - OVERREACH)
**Actual:** 15h40 vs 12h35 planned (+25% OVERREACH)

| Discipline | Sessions | Time | Distance |
|------------|----------|------|----------|
| Swim | 2/3 | 133min | 2,075m |
| Bike | 4/4 | 512min | 231.2km |
| Run | 4/4 | 295min | 47.8km |

**Key Sessions:**
- VO2max bike: 100min, 78x 30/30s intervals @ 285-292W
- Long bike EXTENDED: 3h52 / 120.8km (vs 165min/95km planned - +67min!)
- Long run EXTENDED: 140min / 23.3km (vs 110min/16-17km planned - +30min!)
- Anaerobic run: 5x4min @ 4:21-4:27/km

**CONSEQUENCE:** +25% volume overreach caused Week 11 fatigue. Extensions when feeling good created fatigue debt.

### Week 11: Jan 19-25 (Peak - FATIGUE IMPACT)
**Actual:** ~10h40 vs 14h05 planned

**Fatigue Impact:**
- Monday: Needed unplanned rest (planned was swim)
- Tuesday bike: Failed after 24min - couldn't complete 2nd set
- Used Garmin recommendations instead of structured plan

**Still Completed:**
- Long bike: 4h03 / 125.6km (peak distance achieved despite fatigue)
- Long run: 2h30 / 24.7km (peak achieved)

**Garmin Data Insights:**
- Acute Training Load: At ceiling (~1750-1800)
- Low Aerobic: 2077 (overloaded - too much Z2)
- High Aerobic: 1786 (at optimal ceiling)
- Anaerobic: 747 (below optimal - deficit)
- HRV Status: Balanced

### Week 12: Jan 26 - Feb 1 (Recovery)
**Actual:** 6h53 vs 6h40 planned (103%)

**Context:** Deviated from original recovery plan - turned into productive training week.

| Day | Activity | Duration | Distance | Notes |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Mon | Rest | - | - | |
| Tue | Long swim | 1:55:38 | 4,200m | **Peak swim!** Avg 2:23/100m |
| Wed | Run (aborted) | 24:51 | 3.87km | Ice conditions - smart stop |
| Thu | Pool swim | 38:34 | 575m | Crowded, mostly waiting |
| Fri | Bike 5x5min @105% | 1:02:03 | 33.84km | All intervals @ 236W |
| Sat | Long run + threshold | 2:00:19 | 20.92km | 4x threshold km @ 4:40-5:05 |
| Sun | Easy run | 52:09 | 8.78km | Recovery pace 5:56/km |

| Discipline | Sessions | Time | Distance |
|------------|----------|------|----------|
| Swim | 2 | 2h34 | 4,775m |
| Bike | 1 | 1h02 | 33.8km |
| Run | 3 | 3h17 | 33.6km |

**Key Outcomes:**
- Run threshold confirmed: ~4:40/km @ 172 HR (Sat long run)
- Peak swim distance: 4,200m continuous pool session
- Bike power: 5x5min @ 236W (105% FTP) executed perfectly

## Critical Cycle 3 Learnings

### 1. Weekly Volume Cap: 12h Maximum
Week 10's 15h40 (+25% over plan) caused Week 11 collapse:
- Tuesday session failure
- Monday rest needed (wasn't planned)
- Unable to complete structured workouts

### 2. No Extensions When Feeling Good
Bank energy for hard sessions. Extended long bike (121km) and long run (23km) in Week 10 contributed to next-week fatigue.

### 3. 2 Swims/Week Maximum
Life constraint accepted. Trying to add third swim creates scheduling stress.

### 4. Add Anaerobic Work
Garmin Load Focus showed 747 anaerobic (below optimal). Need short sprint work to address deficit.

### 5. Use Garmin for Daily Readiness
Follow Garmin recommendations for tactical daily adjustments, but don't abandon structured plan entirely.

### 6. Consistent Weekend Structure
- Saturday = Long run
- Sunday = Long bike

## Peak Performances (Cycle 3)

| Metric | Value | Week |
|--------|-------|------|
| Long Bike | 4h03 / 125.6km | Week 11 |
| Long Run | 2h30 / 24.7km | Week 11 |
| **Long Swim** | **1:55 / 4,200m** | **Week 12** |
| FTP | 225W | Week 9 test |
| Mental Toughness | 2h run in heavy snow | Week 9 |

---

## Readiness for Cycle 4

Week 12 was more productive than planned recovery:
- ~7h training maintained fitness without full rest
- Threshold work confirmed run pace improvement (4:40/km)
- Peak swim volume achieved (4,200m)
- Quality bike session (5x5min @ 105% FTP)
- Acute load likely maintained vs. dropped
- Entering Cycle 4 with momentum rather than from full rest
